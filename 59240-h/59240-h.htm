<small>ALLOWED TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Of course, if every reader of this story had also read
its forerunner there would be no need of introducing
its characters, for they would already be old friends.
We would merely meet them at the place where they
have been patiently awaiting us all this time, give them
an encouraging nod of recognition, and tell them to go
ahead with their adventures as fast as they pleased.
That would be well enough for us who are acquainted
with them; but to those who may chance to read this
sequel without having first read the story that gives it
a reason for being, the references to people, things, and
incidents of the past that must necessarily be made
from time to time would be confusing. Therefore it
seems fitting that those characters of the previous story
who are to figure with any prominence in this one
should be properly introduced; and in order to avoid
the discriminating partiality of the author, who would
be apt to say too much concerning those whom he fancied,
or too little about those whom he disliked, each
one shall be given the privilege of introducing himself.
To begin with, here is our old friend Phil Ryder.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is my name right enough, and I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
say first thing that I think it is high time some notice
were taken of us, after the unsatisfactory conclusion of
that other book, and the wretched state of uncertainty
in which we were all left. It seemed to me the very
worst ending to a story that I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“But, Phil, it wasn’t the end. There was to be a
sequel.”</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t say so, and nobody knew, and I
for one have been greatly mortified ever since, without
a chance to say a word on the subject either. Now, as
to myself, if any one cares to know who I am, and
where I am, and how I got here, I am the son of Mr.
John Ryder, of New London, Connecticut. He is a
mining expert, and is at present engaged to investigate
some properties near Sitka, Alaska, where I was to
have joined him last May. It is now September, and
I haven’t got there yet, though I have been travelling
steadily ever since April, and trying my very best to
reach Sitka. I’m sure it isn’t my fault that things
have happened to take me most everywhere else, and
finally to drop me away up here in northern Alaska,
two thousand miles or so beyond Sitka. I’m on the
right track now, though, for I am on a steamboat belonging
to Mr. Hamer, bound up the Yukon River. It
will take me to the head of navigation. Then all I
shall have to do will be to cross the Divide to Chilkat,
and take another steamer for Sitka, which place I expect
to reach before the winter is over. Then my
father’s anxiety will be relieved, for I suppose he is
anxious, though I can’t see why he should be. He must
know that I am perfectly well able to take care of myself,
and will turn up all right some time. Both he and
Aunt Ruth seem to think that I am careless and liable
to get into scrapes, while really I never do anything
important without the most careful consideration—that
is, whenever there is time for considering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“For instance, I didn’t decide that to go up the
Yukon was the very best and shortest way to reach
Sitka until I had talked it all over with Serge. I’m
awfully glad it is the best thing to do, though, for it
is so much more interesting to travel over a new route
than back by the one you have just come. That’s one
reason I wouldn’t pay any attention to that schooner
we passed soon after leaving St. Michaels, though she
did seem to be trying to signal us. I was afraid she
might be bound south to Oonalaska, or even to Sitka
itself, in which case our plans would have been all upset
again. I should have hated that, for if there is any
one thing I believe in it is sticking to a plan and carrying
it out after it is once decided upon. So does
Serge, who is one of the very best fellows that ever
lived, even if he is a little slow. I am mighty glad to
have him for a travelling companion, for he is true as
steel and awfully level-headed. I only wish old Jalap
were with us, for he is about the best fun of any one
I know. I don’t suppose we shall ever see him again,
though; and, now that I come to think of it, it does seem
as if we ought to have made a search for him on Oonimak
before leaving in such a hurry. But as we were
prisoners of war on board the cutter, I don’t exactly
see how we could have done anything but what we did.
Here comes Serge now, and you really ought to know
him; so allow me to—”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Phil; we are to introduce ourselves, you
know, and I don’t want to be handicapped by all the
nice things you would be certain to say about me.
Yes, I am Serge—Serge Belcofsky, born in Sitka long
after Alaska became part of the United States. I went
to school there, of course, but after graduating I still
longed for a better education than Sitka afforded, so I
shipped aboard a homeward-bound whaler for New
London, Connecticut, where I went to school for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
year. There I met Phil Ryder, who was not only the
most popular fellow and the best athlete in the whole
school, but who became the best friend I ever had. If
he wasn’t, I should never have given him the fur-seal’s
tooth which a Chilkat chief gave to my father. On
his death my mother gave it to me, and soon after it
passed into Phil’s hands he lost it. Since then it has
turned up so many times, in such mysterious ways, and
has had so much to do with shaping our fortunes, that
I can’t help believing at least part of the old tales concerning
it. Anyhow, the way it has managed to follow
us right up to date is certainly wonderful. It
isn’t likely that we shall see it again, though, now that
the old Eskimo has got hold of it, for he evidently realizes
its value.</p>

<p>“Where am I now? On a river steamer bound for
Sitka by way of the Yukon, of course. You see, I
left New London almost a year ago and started for
Sitka on the schooner <i>Seamew</i>. At Victoria, British
Columbia, who should I meet but Phil Ryder, who also
shipped on the <i>Seamew</i>. She got to Sitka, but we didn’t,
and though we seem to be headed that way now, while
Phil is confident that we are going straight there, no
one knows what may happen. I hope my dear mother
isn’t worrying about me. If I was only sure of that,
and that I should land Phil in Sitka some time, I know
I should enjoy this trip immensely. But, as Mr. Coombs
says—”</p>

<p>“Hold hard there, hearty! You may allow that
I’m a thousand miles away; but I’m not. And when
it comes to taking words out of my very mouth, you’ll
find that I’m right alongside. As my friend old Kite
Roberson uster say, ‘A man what can’t speak up for
hisself hadn’t orter be allowed to vote.’ My name is
Jalap Coombs, half Yankee and half British subject,
late mate of the <i>Seamew</i>, now acting cap’n of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
schooner <i>Philomeel</i>, in which me and Mr. Ryder is
sarching for the slippery young chaps what has jest
now interdooced theirselves. A while ago we thought
we had ’em, but things happened, and now we’re all at
sea again without an idee of how the wind’ll blow next.
But as old Kite uster offen say, ‘When you don’t know
what <em>to</em> do, the best thing is to do nothing.’ That is
what we are liable to do for some time, seeing as the
<i>Philomeel</i> are hard and fast aground on a mud bank,
with a nor’ wind blowing all the water outer Norton
Sound.”</p>

<p>“And to think that I, John Ryder, after spending
the whole summer in searching for my son Phil, should
at length have actually got within sight of him away
up here almost to the North Pole, only to have the
young scamp sail away and disappear again, as oblivious
of my presence as though I had never existed!
And now this miserable accident, that puts an end to
my following him any farther! Oh, it is too bad! too
bad! I did think that all this miscarriage of plans
and getting lost and being whisked off to all sorts of
out-of-the-way places was purely accidental, or only
owing to the extraordinary carelessness for which Phil
has always been noted. Now, however, I must confess
that it really does look as though he were ready and
willing to go in any direction save towards Sitka. I
can’t conceive what inducements that trader-fellow of
whom Nikrik told us can have offered to entice my
son up the Yukon at this time of the year. From all
accounts the trader must be a pretty bad lot, and I
tremble to think of what may happen to my Phil under
his influence. What did Nikrik say his name
was?”</p>

<p>“Gerald Hamer is my name, and though I have
never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. John Ryder,
from what I have seen of his son I should judge him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to be a man well worth meeting. Phil is certainly a
fine fellow, as well as the best rifle shot I ever ran
across, and I am more than glad to have him join my
expedition. That boy Serge, too, is a trump, and together
they make a strong team, for while the first is
impulsive, careless, and inclined to carry things with a
dash, the other is cool, steady as a rock, and slow to
act, but certain to get there in the end. As for myself,
I am leading an expedition up the Yukon with
the intention of establishing a trading-post at Forty
Mile, a mining camp some two thousand miles up the
river. I hope to reach there in this steamer, the
<i>Chimo</i>, before navigation closes. Then I expect to go
out over the Chilkoot Pass by snow-shoes and sledges,
and so finally reach San Francisco in time to bring up
a new stock of goods for next summer. It is now so
late, though, that I begin to have my doubts as to
whether this plan can be carried out, for I fear we
shall be frozen in long before reaching Forty Mile. I
heard one of the clerks at the Redoubt bet that we
would not reach Nulato.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I, Simon Goldollar, made that bet, and I am
willing to repeat it. I hope they won’t get to Forty
Mile. If they don’t we’ll head them off yet, and teach
them that none but the company can trade on the
Yukon. I am one of the company’s most trusted clerks,
and though I only came out last summer, I think I see
a way to winning promotion by breaking up the plans
of this impudent would-be trader in our territory, and
I am going to propose my scheme to the agent at
once. I am the more anxious to carry it out now that
Phil Ryder, whom I hate, has turned up again, and is
evidently some sort of a partner in this new concern.
He thinks I stole his money when we crossed the continent
together, but I didn’t. Even if I had we would
now be quits, for he has stolen the fur-seal’s tooth from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
me. I know where it is, though, and I’ll have it back
before long. I’ll find some chance to get the best of
him, too, before he leaves the Yukon, and I’ll give him
cause to regret that he ever saw it or Redoubt St. Michaels,
either. See if I don’t.”</p>

<p>“At last I am allowed to speak, and I must say I
think I should have been the first to be presented, for
I am the Fur-seal’s Tooth. My origin is mysterious,
the wonderful carving with which I am covered is
unique, and of course my ultimate fate cannot be foretold;
but whoever has read of me in the book that
bears my name must admit that I exert a powerful influence
over the affairs of men. It is said of me that
he who gives me away gives good luck with me. He
who receives me as a gift receives good luck. He who
loses me loses his luck, and he who steals me steals
bad luck that will cling to him so long as I am retained
in his possession.</p>

<p>“Although I am now in the hands of a wretched
Eskimo, I propose to leave him very shortly, to continue
my travels until I reach my proper resting-place,
and to exert a very considerable influence upon the
forthcoming story. If you doubt my word, just bear
me in mind and watch for my appearance.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A DANGEROUS BERTH OFF YUKON MOUTH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Eighty miles south of Redoubt St. Michaels, the one
lonely trading-station of that bleak northern coast, the
mighty Yukon pours forth its turbid flood, discoloring
the waters of Bering Sea for one hundred miles off
shore. In point of size, as measured by length, the
Yukon ranks seventeenth among the rivers of the
world and fifth among those of the United States, but
its volume of water is computed to be equal to that of
the Mississippi, while, like the Father of Waters, it
is constantly eating away its own banks and tearing
them down, acres at a time, along its entire length.
Thus it has become a shoal stream of immense width,
crowded with islands and sand-bars, on all of which are
huge stacks of bleached driftwood piled up by springtime
floods. In the neighborhood of its fan-like, many-mouthed
delta the tawny giant has deposited its muddy
sediment for so many ages that it has created hundreds
of square miles of low swamp lands, on which only coarse
grasses and stunted willows grow. In the early summer
these vast swamps afford safe breeding-places for
millions of swans, ducks, and geese. Here also are
produced such incredible swarms of mosquitoes that
neither human beings nor animals dare penetrate their
watery solitudes. Nor are mosquitoes confined to the
Yukon delta; but its entire valley is so infested with
them that summer is a season to be dreaded by whites
and natives alike. Even the wild animals of its forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
retreat to the snow-clad mountains, so that there is
little or no game to be procured between spring and
autumn. The only compensation of the season is that
it brings the finest salmon of the world into the river
in such vast shoals that every dweller within one
hundred miles of its banks may from them lay in
his year’s supply of food by the labor of a single
month.</p>

<div class="caption">ESKIMO HUT, MOUTH OF THE YUKON</div>
</div>

<p>In the summer, too, the four or five trade-boats—all
light-draught, stern-wheeled steamers like the <i>Chimo</i>—that
ply on the river make their annual trips, with
provisions, goods, and an eight months’ accumulation
of mail, carrying joy to lonely mission-stations and
trading-posts, native villages, and distant mining-camps.
On their return in the fall they are freighted
with gold-dust and the spoils of the most prolific fur-producing
district now left to the world.</p>

<p>These things formed the principal topics of conversation
in the pilot-house of the sturdy little <i>Chimo</i> as,
aided by a strong north wind, she swept down the desolate
coast of Norton Sound. The six-by-seven-foot
enclosure was occupied by Gerald Hamer, the stalwart
leader of the expedition, by Phil and Serge, and by an
Eskimo pilot, who had been obtained at St. Michaels.
The two boys were in there for warmth, for the season
was late September, which in that latitude is very close
to the beginning of winter, and the brisk north wind
held so keen an edge that no one remained on deck
unless forced to do so.</p>

<p>Gerald Hamer was there to watch his native pilot,
in whom he had little confidence. He was also uneasy
concerning his boat, which had been put together in
the greatest haste on the beach, just beyond the Redoubt,
in the face of all possible annoyance from its
inmates; they being devoted to the cause of the already
established company, were determined that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
other trader should gain a foothold in the country if
they could prevent it.</p>

<p>Being anxious to obtain the good-will of the natives
from the outset, Gerald Hamer had allowed a number
of them who dwelt in the Yukon delta, and were desirous
of returning home, to take passage on the <i>Chimo</i>,
which towed their walrus-skin bidarrahs, or open boats,
behind her. These passengers—men, women, and children,
fat, greasy, and happy—made themselves perfectly
at home on the lower or cargo deck of the
steamer, sprawling over her freight, peering inquisitively
at her engine, and revelling in the combined
odors of steam and oil pervading that part of the boat.</p>

<p>Before half the distance down the coast was covered,
mysterious accidents began to happen to the
machinery. First it came to a stop, and the engineer
reported that something had so seriously gone wrong
that it would be necessary to anchor while he made an
examination. To the horror and dismay of all hands,
a gunny sack was found to be stuffed so far into the
exhaust that the pipe had to be taken apart before the
obstruction could be reached and removed. Not long
after this danger was averted, one of the pumps refused
to work. It was taken to pieces, and was found
to contain a large nail, which must have been recently
dropped into it. There was no doubt but that these
things had been done intentionally; and as suspicion
naturally fell on the native passengers, some of whom
were known to be in the employ of the old company,
Gerald Hamer finally ordered them to leave the
steamer.</p>

<p>Not understanding the cause of this peremptory order,
and being loath to exchange their present comfortable
quarters for the open boats, the natives obeyed so
slowly and sulkily that it almost seemed as though they
were about to insist on remaining aboard. At length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
however, all were gone except one woman, who held a
child in her arms, and who refused to leave the warm
corner of which she had taken possession.</p>

<p>Determined to get rid of her, and despairing of
moving her by other means, Gerald Hamer suddenly
snatched the child from her arms, ran to the open gangway,
and dropped it gently into a bidarrah that still
waited alongside. In an instant the mother had followed,
and could be seen as the boat was shoved off
hugging the infant to her bosom, at the same time darting
furious glances after the departing steamer. A
minute later, as though in compliance with her evident
though unexpressed wish, the <i>Chimo</i> was run hard and
fast aground on one of the innumerable bars that so
jealously guard Yukon mouth. Her native steersman
had been leaning from the pilot-house door watching
the dismissal of his compatriots, and especially that of
his own wife and baby, as the last two put off afterwards
proved to be, instead of attending to his duty.</p>

<p>Phil, who remained in the pilot-house, saw the bank
just before the boat struck, and snatched the wheel
hard over, at the same time signalling to stop and
back at full speed. But it was all too late, and ere she
could be stopped the <i>Chimo</i> had slid half her length
into the treacherous mud. In another minute the fleet
of bidarrahs swept by, and from them came mocking
laughter mingled with derisive shouts. One of them
ran alongside, and ere any one on the steamer knew
what was taking place <a href="#i_fp012">the native pilot had deserted
his post</a>, and was being borne away in triumph by his
fellows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_11">THE NATIVE PILOT DESERTS HIS POST</a></div>
</div>

<p>“I only hope nothing worse will come of it,” said
Phil, anxiously, when Gerald Hamer finally rejoined
him in the pilot-house.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, the pilot said something about that baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
having the measles, which I understand have been
pretty bad on the river this summer, and if that is the
case some of us may have caught them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess there’s no danger,” replied the captain,
carelessly, his mind at that moment being too fully occupied
with the condition of his vessel to allow of
other thoughts.</p>

<p>It was too late to do anything that evening, for the
short Northern day was already merged in dusk, and
the next morning, though anchors were carried out
astern, they came home through the soft mud as if it
were so much water the moment a strain was put on
them. Sheer-poles were rigged, and an attempt was
made to pry the boat off by means of them; but
again the mud offered so little resistance that the effort
only resulted in failure. So, after working like
beavers for hours, the <i>Chimo’s</i> crew resigned themselves
to waiting as patiently as might be for a change
of wind and higher water.</p>

<p>In this enforced delay three precious days were
spent, and nightfall of the third found the <i>Chimo</i> still
outside Yukon mouth instead of one hundred miles or
more inland, as had been hoped. Still, with so energetic
a leader as Gerald Hamer, those three days were
by no means wasted. He overhauled and restowed
the cargo hurriedly put on board at St. Michaels, and
with the engineer made a thorough examination of
the machinery. He reorganized his slender crew, appointing
Phil and Serge first and second mates, and
giving each charge of a watch.</p>

<p>Besides the captain, the two mates, and the engineer,
there were three other persons in the crew. Two of
them were millwrights, who were going to Forty Mile
to set up the saw-mill that formed part of the <i>Chimo’s</i>
cargo, but who now served as firemen. The third was
a sullen-faced fellow named Strengel, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
engaged from the steamer <i>Norsk</i>, which brought the
expedition to St. Michaels, to act as assistant engineer.
Phil took a dislike to this fellow from the first, and it
was strengthened by the fact that he seemed to have
contracted an intimacy with some of the inmates of
the Redoubt, who were avowed enemies of the expedition.</p>

<p>Besides doing the things already mentioned, the
captain and his two young mates took a small boat
and staked out about ten miles of the channel that the
<i>Chimo</i> would follow as soon as she again floated.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day the wind changed,
and as the steamer would probably float during the
night the captain ordered steam to be got up and
everything made ready for a start at daylight. He
turned in early, complaining of great weariness and
many pains, which he attributed to the cold and the
frequent drenchings that had accompanied his sounding
of the channel.</p>

<p>The following morning, when Phil went to report
that the steamer was afloat, and also to make a grave
charge against Assistant Engineer Strengel, he was horrified
to find the captain raving in the delirium of a
high fever. Thus to his intense dismay the young
mate suddenly found himself burdened with the entire
responsibility of the expedition, with both a mutiny
and a very sick man on his hands, in an unfriendly
country, and about to be confronted with the terrors
of an arctic winter.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>MEASLES AND MUTINY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As Phil realized the full gravity of the situation he
instinctively shrank from assuming the responsibility
so unexpectedly thrust upon him. One of his aunt
Ruth’s long-ago stories of a poor little bear who found
himself alone in the great big world with all his
troubles before him flashed into the boy’s mind, and
he said to himself, “This little bear’s troubles have
met him, sure enough, and in full force.”</p>

<p>But why should he assume this responsibility? This
was not his expedition, and he had no interest in it
save that of a passenger. It did not seem at all likely
that it could succeed now, and as they must apparently
return to St. Michaels sooner or later, why not do so
at once, and get out of this scrape the easiest way possible.
Or why not turn the whole business over to
Mr. Sims, the engineer, who was well paid for his
work, and who was supposed to have counted the cost
of failure as well as of success. Yes, that was the
thing to do: shift the responsibility to Mr. Sims, who
was paid for assuming such duties.</p>

<p>But hold on, Phil Ryder! Have you not also been
paid, at the very highest rate too, by the man who
now lies so helpless before you, and whose fortunes
are in your hands? Did he not rescue you from a
certain death out there in those cold, cruel waters,
when your bidarkie was on the point of foundering?
Did you not gladly accept his offer to accompany him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
on this trip when all appeared smooth sailing? Have
you not been fed and clothed at his expense? Above
all, has he not proved his confidence in you by appointing
you to a position of trust? Are such things as
gratitude and loyalty unknown to you? You were
proud to be called first mate yesterday, and now you
shrink from performing the first and most evident
duty of the office. You owe everything to Gerald
Hamer, and yet you would intrust his fortunes to a
man whom you know to be a drunkard whenever liquor
is within his reach, and on whose movements the
captain bade you keep a close watch. Shame on you,
Phil Ryder! What would Serge say if you should do
this cowardly thing? Would you ever dare face his
honest gaze again?</p>

<p>These thoughts, which flashed through Phil’s mind
in a few seconds, stung him as though they had been
so many clearly uttered words. The hot blood rushed
to his cheeks, and with a very determined look on his
face the lad walked forward. He found Serge in
the pilot-house, and at once laid the situation before
him. In conclusion, he said:</p>

<p>“We must make some move at once, for this westerly
wind is kicking up such a sea that our anchors
won’t hold much longer. It would be even more dangerous
to attempt a return to St. Michaels than to lie
here. Besides that, to place ourselves at the mercy of
our enemies for the winter would mean the utter ruin
of the expedition and the loss to Gerald Hamer of
every cent he has in the world. So, under the circumstances,
as the present command of this craft seems
to devolve on me, I propose to continue on our course,
get rid of that fellow Strengel at the first opportunity,
and push on up the river until our farther progress is
barred by ice, or until we discover a good place in
which to lay the boat up for the winter. We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
surely find white men somewhere who will help us,
too.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Serge, “we are certain to if we can
only get as far as the Anvik Mission. At any rate,
Phil, what you propose to do is exactly the right thing,
and you can count on me to back you up to the last
gasp.”</p>

<p>“I knew I could, old man,” replied Phil, warmly.
“Now let’s go below and make ready to start.”</p>

<p>Calling on the two millwrights to follow them, Phil
and Serge made their way to the engine-room, where
they found the engineer just rousing from a heavy
sleep, which Phil strongly suspected had been aided
by liquor.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sims,” said he, “what would be the effect if a
cylinder-head should blow out under a full head of
steam?”</p>

<p>“The effect?” replied the engineer, slowly, and evidently
surprised at the question. “Why, any one who
happened to be in range would be killed, all in this
part of the boat would be more or less scalded, and
the chances are that this expedition would come to a
very sudden termination.”</p>

<p>“Of course yours is all right?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; I examined it only yesterday,” replied
the engineer, testily. “Now, if you are through with
your foolish questions, it seems to me you’d better notify
the captain that everything is ready for a start. I
don’t want to waste steam by blowing off, and there’s
more on now than we ought to carry.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind stepping this way a moment?”
asked Phil, taking the engine-room lantern and holding
it back of the cylinder.</p>

<p>Moved by curiosity as to what the young seal-hunter
could be up to, the engineer stepped forward, gave
one look, and uttered a cry of horror. More than half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the bolts holding the massive cylinder-head in place
had been loosened.</p>

<p>“Upon my honor, I knew nothing of this thing, Mr.
Ryder,” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t,” answered Phil, grimly;
“for it was done while you were sleeping off the effect
of those brandied peaches. Where is Strengel?”</p>

<p>“He is aft somewhere. But surely, Mr. Ryder, you
don’t suspect him of this dastardly act?”</p>

<p>“Go and tell him to come here,” ordered Phil, turning
to one of the millwrights.</p>

<p>In a moment the man returned, and reported that
Strengel claimed to be too busy to come just then.</p>

<p>With an expressive glance at his friend, Phil left the
engine-room, and Serge followed him. A minute later,
in the resistless grasp of the two athletic young fellows,
Mr. Strengel was being rushed along the deck so
rapidly as to suggest that he had very imperative business
in the engine-room.</p>

<p>“<a href="#i_fp018">Here</a>, gentlemen, <a href="#i_fp018">is the man who did that thing</a>!”
cried Phil, as he gave the breathless and trembling
wretch a shove that landed him in a corner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_fp018">
  <img src="images/i_fp018.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_17">“HERE IS THE MAN WHO DID THAT THING”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“So help me, Mr. Ryder—” he began, abjectly.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” shouted Phil, “and don’t you dare speak
again until you are spoken to. There is no doubt of
his guilt, gentlemen, for I saw him loosening those
bolts as plainly as I see him now, when I came down
here awhile ago to make ready for starting. He did
not see me, for I was in darkness, while he worked by
lantern-light. So I watched him for a full minute
while he prepared this death-trap for the rest of us.
No wonder he has sought the most distant and safest
part of the ship ever since.</p>

<p>“Moreover, it is this man who, on two previous occasions,
has attempted to cripple our machinery. He
is employed by the old company to injure and delay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
this expedition by every possible means. From the
evidence before us it looks as though he would not hesitate
to commit murder to accomplish his designs.
Now, gentlemen, what, in your opinion, ought to be
done with such a bit of scum?”</p>

<p>“Shoot him! Throw him overboard!” suggested
two of the little group in a breath, while Serge said
nothing, but tightened his clutch of the prisoner’s collar
ominously.</p>

<p>“Turn him over to the captain,” said the engineer;
“he’ll settle the case in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“That is what I started to do, and what I am afraid
of,” replied Phil. “The captain has sworn to shoot on
sight the first man he catches tampering with the machinery
of this boat, and I don’t believe he’d hesitate
a moment before doing it, either. At the same time,
gentlemen, we don’t want to have any bloodshed on
the <i>Chimo</i> if we can help it. It would not only give
her a bad name and injure our prospects on the river,
but would furnish us with a cause of regret for the
rest of our lives. So I thought I would ask your opinion
before reporting this affair to the captain.</p>

<p>“My plan would be to get under way as quietly as
possible, which the captain ordered me to do anyway,
if we were afloat at daylight, and run over to the Pastolik
wood-yard. There we’ll give the scoundrel a
chance to slip ashore and hide himself. He’ll be picked
up fast enough by the natives who own the yard. We
won’t make any stop there, but will run on up our
staked channel and be out of sight before anything is
said to the captain. Thus we shall get rid of our
murderer without having his blood on our hands, and
at the same time leave him where there won’t be the
slightest chance of his troubling us any more. In fact,
I’m inclined to think that if he once gets safely out of
this boat, he’ll be wise enough never to come near her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
again. I shall be sorry for him if he does, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>After some discussion, during which the wretched
prisoner watched the faces of his judges with painful
eagerness, this plan was accepted. Under strictest
supervision of the engineer, Strengel was made to repair
his own mischief. Then with Serge to keep careful
watch of affairs on the lower deck, and with Phil
at the wheel, the <i>Chimo</i> steamed away from the place
of her long detention. As she neared the Pastolik
wood-yard Strengel was not only ready to leap ashore
at the first opportunity, but he was warned by the angry
mutterings of those about him that to remain on
board a moment longer than was necessary would place
his life in imminent jeopardy.</p>

<p>So, as the steamer rubbed against the bank, he made
a leap; his bag was flung after him, and, without having
come to a full stop, the <i>Chimo</i> moved on, Phil
ringing the jingle-bell for full speed the moment it
was safe to do so.</p>

<p>It is hard to say which was the more pleased at this
successful termination of the affair: Phil to be so easily
rid of a dangerous member of his crew, or the wretch
who had so easily escaped a well-merited punishment.</p>

<p>As soon as the steamer again reached the staked
channel, Phil resigned the wheel to Serge, and, calling
on the two millwrights to aid him, removed the stricken
captain to the lower deck. There a bed had been
prepared for him in a warm corner, near the boiler,
which was carefully curtained by tarpaulins against
any draught of cold air. Although the young mate
had but slight knowledge of sickness, and was still uncertain
as to the nature of Gerald Hamer’s illness, he
knew that warmth would do his patient no harm, and
that in a case of measles it was necessary to a successful
treatment of the disease.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>PHIL ASSUMES COMMAND AND ASSERTS HIS AUTHORITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was much alarm among the scanty crew of
the <i>Chimo</i> when the pitiable state of their leader was
discovered, and the engineer was especially loud in his
protests against attempting to continue the voyage
under such discouraging conditions. He declared that
none but madmen would think of doing such a thing,
and that unless they immediately returned to St. Michaels
they would all perish in that wilderness of icy
water and frozen mud. At first the millwrights, who
had heretofore had no experience in rough travel, were
inclined to agree with him; but Phil stated his view
of the situation so clearly, and was so sturdily supported
by Serge, that they were finally won over to
his way of thinking. So the discontented engineer
was forced to yield to the wishes of the majority.</p>

<p>Five miles from Pastolik they stopped at the Eskimo
village of Coatlik for a supply of wood, and here
Serge, with his ability to speak Russian, proved invaluable.
Not only did he conduct the wood negotiations,
but he succeeded in purchasing a number of
freshly killed wild-geese, which were at that time flying
southward in vast flocks. Above all, he secured a
native pilot, who promised to go with them until they
met running ice.</p>

<p>Nor did the services of the young Russo-American
diminish one whit in value after Coatlik was left behind.
He alone knew how to prepare the broths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
which formed the sole nourishment that the sick man
was able to take. He only could converse with the
native pilot, and learn from him the mysteries of the
mighty river. He it was who was always cheerful,
and could swing the lustiest axe, when, as often happened,
they were obliged to renew their supply of fuel
from chance drift piles; and it was he who must attend
the sick man at night, because the faintest murmur
served to wake him. So Serge was the very life
of that dreary voyage, and but for him Phil knew it
must have been abandoned long before they reached
the haven for which they were steering.</p>

<p>And it was a dreary voyage. Day after day witnessed
the same monotony of turbid waters, so widespread
that one bank was often invisible from the
other, and a deadly level of drowned lands bounded
only by the low, far-away horizon. Day after day
brought the same gray skies, chill winds, rain squalls,
and flurries of snow. Every night saw heavy frosts,
and it grew hourly more apparent that the stern reign
of winter was close at hand.</p>

<p>At long intervals lonely groups of sod-covered huts
gave sign that human beings dwelt even in those unlovely
wastes, but save for fuel the young commander
of the <i>Chimo</i> would not pause to make their acquaintance.
From earliest dawn until dusk he forced
the little craft at full speed against the swift current,
often grounding on sand-bars in spite of the native pilot,
whose only knowledge was of the best channel but not
of its obstructions.</p>

<p>After two days they began to see low hills on the
north, and on this side the river-bank became noticeably
higher. Although this was encouraging, it produced
but slight impression on the spirits of the depressed
crew, whose situation was indeed becoming
alarming. They were worn out with anxiety, overwork,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and insufficient food, for they had neither the
time nor inclination to do any cooking except for the
sick. The captain lay in a state of semi-stupor, and
another cot within the same enclosure held one of the
millwrights, who had been stricken with the dread disease
twenty-four hours later.</p>

<p>By the end of the first week in October they were
some two hundred miles from the mouth of the river,
with nearly one hundred yet to go before they could
reach Anvik, to gain which Phil was directing all his
energies. He knew not what they would find there;
but he had an intuition that help of some kind awaited
them at that point. At any rate, he was determined
to reach it somehow.</p>

<p>On the 7th of October ice began to run in the river,
and with its first appearance the native pilot insisted
upon starting back towards his now distant home.
That night, amid the howlings of a tempest that threatened
to tear the <i>Chimo</i> from her anchorage, the
stricken millwright died.</p>

<p>When Phil went to the engineer’s room to report
this distressing news he was filled with wrath to
find that individual lying in his bunk and indulging
to excess in the contents of a case of brandied peaches
that he had stolen from the cargo.</p>

<p>Without a word Phil picked up the case and flung
it into the river. “I’ll see you again in the morning,
sir, when you are sober,” he said, as he left the
room, and, locking the door, put the key in his own
pocket.</p>

<p>That night of storm, death, and despair was one
that neither Phil nor Serge will ever forget. For long
hours they sat by the bedside of the captain, whom
they believed to be sleeping, discussing in low tones
their melancholy situation.</p>

<p>Suddenly they were startled by a voice from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sick man, who said, feebly, “Get me to Anvik, boys, if
you can, and you will save my life.”</p>

<p>It was the first time he had spoken rationally for
several days, and they had no idea that he was even
conscious of their presence; but Phil answered,
promptly, “All right, captain; we’ll get you there,
never fear.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Serge, cheerily, “you may rest easy,
sir, for when Phil uses that tone he means just what
he says, and I know that I’ve got to back him up.”</p>

<p>Neither of the lads got more than an hour’s sleep
that night, and long before daylight they were again
at work. Phil and the surviving millwright were getting
up steam, while Serge was taking unusual pains
in preparing breakfast, for they all realized that they
must now lay in an extra supply of strength.</p>

<p>Not until breakfast was ready was Mr. Sims released
from the confinement of his room. After eating his
meal in sullen silence he said to Phil, “Well, young
man, what do you propose to do to-day?”</p>

<p>“I propose to push on up the river as usual.”</p>

<p>“And who are you going to get to run your engine?”</p>

<p>“I expect you to do it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are expecting a good deal more than
you’ll get,” cried the man, rising from the table in his
excitement. “I’ve been bullied by a parcel of boys
just as long as I intend to be; so now I want you to
understand that I’ll not allow the engine of this boat
to make another turn except to run her into winter-quarters,
and that’s got to be done in a hurry, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I mean to do with her,” replied
Phil, quietly.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At Anvik, less than one hundred miles from here.”</p>

<p>“Hundred nothing!” screamed the man. “You’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
put her in winter-quarters within ten miles of this very
spot or not at all; for you can’t run the engine, and
you haven’t got a man aboard except me who can, and
you know it.”</p>

<p>The furious man had stepped towards Phil, and was
shaking a trembling fist in the lad’s face as he shouted
these last words. Serge stood close behind him.</p>

<p>Just then the young mate nodded his head; both
lads sprang upon the man at once, and in spite of his
fierce struggles bore him to the deck. In another
moment he was securely and helplessly bound.</p>

<p>“How do we generally dispose of mutineers aboard
this ship?” asked Phil, as he regained his feet.</p>

<p>“Set ’em ashore, sir, and leave ’em to shift for themselves,”
answered Serge, grimly.</p>

<p>“Very well; and as we haven’t any time to lose, you
may get the dingey overboard at once. Call Isaac to
help you, and tell him the reason for this extra work.”</p>

<p>“You don’t dare do it,” muttered the prostrate man,
as Serge started to obey this order.</p>

<p>“Don’t I?” queried Phil. “If you think so you
must be ignorant of what constitutes a mutiny, as
well as of the powers vested in the captain of a ship.”</p>

<p>“But you aren’t the captain of this ship.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’m not. At the same time I am acting
as captain by authority of the owner, and I am performing
all of a captain’s duties; <em>all</em> of them, you
understand.”</p>

<p>By this time the small boat was alongside, and
leaving the bewildered millwright in her, Serge regained
the deck, where he awaited further instructions.</p>

<p>“Select such of your belongings as you wish to take
with you, and they shall be put into the boat,” said
Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, rats!” cried the man, angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take hold of him!” ordered the mate.</p>

<p>Serge obeyed, and in another minute the mutinous
engineer found himself in the small boat, which was
actually being shoved off.</p>

<p>“Shall I hunt a native village to leave him at?”
asked Serge.</p>

<p>“No. We haven’t time for that. Land him wherever
it happens.”</p>

<p>“Look here, boys,” said the man, humbly, as he cast
a shuddering glance over the icy waters and at the
bleak desolation of the shore beyond. “I weaken.
Take me back, and I’ll go to work.”</p>

<p>“Will you run the engine as far as Anvik?”</p>

<p>“I’ll run her till you give the word to stop.”</p>

<p>“And promise on your honor not to touch another
drop of liquor before this steamer is laid up in winter-quarters?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>So that was the end of the mutiny, and once more
the <i>Chimo</i> held her way up the great river, whose
swift current was now covered with floating ice as
far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon a new bewilderment confronted
the anxious lads. They were involved in a labyrinth
of channels, all of about the same width, and apparently
pouring forth equal volumes of water. But
while they all looked equally inviting, only one was
that of the main river; the others were mouths of the
great Shagelook slough, which would lead them into
an unknown wilderness. One meant safety and the
others disaster. But which was which?</p>

<p>In this dilemma Phil decided to anchor and wait for
another daylight. While they thus waited—wearied,
anxious, and wellnigh despairing—there came a shout
from out of the darkness that thrilled them with a new
life, for the words were in their own tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Steamer ahoy! ahoy! Hello on board the steamer!”
rang cheerily from off the dark waters.</p>

<p>“Hello! hello! Come this way!” answered Phil
from the pilot-house.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>A PARSON AT THE WHEEL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Phil had been sitting alone in the pilot-house, where,
in the chill darkness, the weight of his responsibility
seemed almost too great to be borne. He had held
out bravely until this moment, but now it seemed as
though a great black wall of difficulty was reared
against him, and that it was gradually enclosing him
on all sides. The many channels revealed by the waning
light of that day must all be explored ere the right
one could be determined. Phil dared not consider
how many days might thus be spent, for he knew he
had no days nor even hours to spare.</p>

<p>At any moment now the river might close, and once
caught in the relentless fetters of its ice the <i>Chimo</i>
must remain motionless until crushed and swept away
by the resistless fury of the spring floods. In the
meantime what would become of her little company,
stranded there in the open river, exposed to the full
fury of arctic blasts, remote from human habitation,
and equally so from any visible supply of fuel? They
had not even the fur clothing without which none may
spend a winter in that region.</p>

<p>To be sure, as soon as the ice would bear them they
might make their way to some wretched native village,
and there drag out a miserable existence during the long
winter months. Even in that sorry retreat there could
be no hope for Gerald Hamer, who must either be left
behind to perish, or taken with them to meet an equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
certain fate from exposure. As poor Phil reflected
on these things he asked himself why he had so obstinately
forced the expedition farther and farther into
the wilderness, day after day, until he had at length
brought it to this danger point. Why had he not
laid the boat up in the first winter harbor that offered?
He could remember that they had passed several very
good ones, some of which were in the vicinity of
Eskimo villages.</p>

<p>Why? Because he had made up his mind to reach
Anvik, and declared his intention of doing so, and his
Yankee grit was not of the kind to be daunted by
obstacles nor turned back by them from an uncompleted
duty. Why? Because he had promised Captain
Hamer to carry him to Anvik. Phil Ryder did
not often make promises, being opposed to them
on general principles, but when he did make one he
kept it. Why? Because while he was thus thinking,
that cheery voice came ringing out of the darkness,
bringing with it such a thrill of hope and relief that
just to hear it was worth all the toil and anxiety expended
in reaching that point.</p>

<p>Serge was down in the galley cooking supper, and
whistling a melancholy little tune, that tried its best
to sound cheerful as he did so. Poor Isaac, the millwright,
homesick, grief-stricken, and despairing, was
working by lantern-light on a rude coffin for his dead
comrade. Mr. Sims, morose and silent, was busy with
his machinery, while Gerald Hamer tossed wearily but
weakly beneath the piled-up coverings of his narrow
bed.</p>

<p>All heard the first shout of that unknown voice, and
each suspended operations to listen. When it came
again, and they heard Phil’s answering hail, all rushed
to the gangway on that side, that is, all except the
sick man, and there, holding flashing lanterns to guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
him, they excitedly awaited <a href="#i_fp028">the approach of the unknown</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>While they peered vaguely into the gloom, listening
for the slatting of sails or the rattle of oars, he
suddenly swept alongside, seated in an Eskimo kyak
or skin boat, very similar to the one in which Phil and
Serge had made their perilous voyage on Bering Sea
a month before, only much smaller.</p>

<p>They could see that he was a white man, wearing a
thick, close-cut brown beard; but otherwise he might
easily have been mistaken for a native, so completely
was he enveloped in a kamleika. The hood of this
was drawn over his head, while its ample skirts were
fastened to the coaming of the hatch in which he sat,
so as to prevent the entrance of water.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t a bit of good-fortune, then I
don’t know what good-fortune is!” he exclaimed, smiling
up at the eager faces peering at him from the
steamer’s side. “May I come aboard?”</p>

<p>“May you come aboard?” cried Phil. “Well, sir,
I rather think you may, for even if you didn’t want
to, I am afraid we should capture you and drag you on
board by force. Why, we couldn’t be more delighted
to see you if you were the President of the United
States himself.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if you can be half as happy to see me as I
am to meet with you thus fortunately and unexpectedly,”
laughed the stranger.</p>

<p>“In that case,” replied Phil, “you must be the very
happiest person in the world, for you have made me
almost that.”</p>

<p>During this interchange of courtesies the stranger
had been unlashing his kamleika, and now, stepping
lightly from his fragile craft, he gained the deck, to
which his kyak was also lifted.</p>

<p>“Ah! but this is cosey and comfortable,” he remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as he entered the well-lighted mess-room, which opened
from the galley and was warmed by its glowing stove.
Serge had just finished his preparations for supper, and
the well-laden mess-table did indeed present a sight
calculated to cheer the heart of a hungry man, especially
one who had been for hours battling with the
ice of an Alaskan river.</p>

<p>“You gentlemen seem to be travelling and living
like princes,” continued the stranger; “but I must
confess to considerable surprise at finding you on the
river so late in the season. You are bound down and
out, I presume?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Phil, “we are bound up the
river, and hope to reach Anvik before it closes.”</p>

<p>“Anvik!” cried the stranger. “Why, that is the
place to which I also am going.”</p>

<p>“Alone, at night, and in a bidarkie?” asked Phil, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed the other, “though I was only trying
to cross the river to-night for fear it might close
before morning, and leave me stranded on the farther
bank. It was a reckless thing to undertake, I acknowledge,
and but for your timely presence I might have
come to serious grief ere this. It had grown so dark
before I sighted your lights that I could no longer
avoid the floating ice, and was in great fear that my
boat would be cut open. You may believe, then, that
I was glad to see them. Now, to find myself seated
among those of my own race, and at a civilized table
after a rather trying experience of Eskimo hospitality,
caps the climax and renders my content complete.”</p>

<p>“Are you on a hunting or fishing trip, sir?” asked
Phil, anxious to establish the status of this new acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Neither, just now,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>“Trading, perhaps?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p>“Travelling for pleasure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, so far as it is a pleasure to do my work.”</p>

<p>“Prospecting?”</p>

<p>“For some things, though not for gold.”</p>

<p>“In government employ?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Working for the company, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“If you mean for the fur-trading company, I am
not.”</p>

<p>Phil was nonplussed, and knew not what to ask next.
In fact, but for the stranger’s affable manner and quizzical
smile he would not have pushed his inquiries so
far as he had. Finally he said: “I need not ask if
you are a good boatman, for any one who can manage
a bidarkie as well as you do must be that. I do
want to make one more inquiry, though, and I hope
you will excuse my inquisitiveness, but we are in distress
and greatly need assistance. Are you a Yukon
pilot?”</p>

<p>“For that part of the river lying between here and
Anvik I am,” replied the stranger. “In fact, I know
it so well that I would not hesitate to run it in the
dark. Furthermore, to satisfy your very proper curiosity
concerning an utter stranger, who has forced
himself upon your hospitality, I will say that I am a
trader, a prospector, a fisherman, a hunter, a boatman,
a mechanic, a writer, a teacher, something each of a
lawyer, a physician, and a surgeon; and, above all, I
am a preacher of the Word of God, for I am a missionary
of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and stationed
at Anvik.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, are you, really?” cried Phil. “Then you
are the very man I have wanted most to meet. Had I
not heard that you were at Anvik, and believed you
would help us, I don’t think I should have dared bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the boat even as far as I have. I was trying to make
up my mind what to do next, and had almost decided
not to attempt a further ascent of the river, but to go
into the best winter-quarters we could find to-morrow.
You see we are all mixed up as to the channels, and
greatly afraid of being caught by the ice.”</p>

<p>“As well you may be,” replied the missionary.
“But, pardon my curiosity, you speak of bringing the
boat to this place as though you were her captain. Is
that the case?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Phil, with a flush. “I am only her
first mate, while Serge here is second, and Mr. Sims is
engineer. But I am acting as captain during the illness
of our real captain, Mr. Gerald Hamer, who is
down with the measles.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said the missionary, gravely. “I am
very sorry to hear that, for in this climate, especially,
measles is a serious sickness and has been a terrible
scourge on the river. I have just been spending a few
days at one of the Shagelook villages installing a native
teacher in place of one who died of measles a few
weeks ago. How long has your captain been ill?”</p>

<p>“Since the day we entered the river.”</p>

<p>“And do you mean to say that you have navigated
the steamer all this distance without help?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, sir! I have had the help of Serge, who is
a capital sailor and can talk Russian besides, and of
Mr. Sims, who is a first-class engineer, and of Isaac,
who is a millwright, but who makes one of the best
firemen I ever saw, and we had another millwright,
only he died last night, and a native pilot part of the
way.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have certainly shown an immense
amount of pluck and perseverance,” exclaimed the
missionary, “and I don’t think I know another boy of
your age who would have done as well, for you don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
look as though you were out of your teens yet. Are
you?”</p>

<p>“Almost,” answered Phil, again flushing. “That is,
I shall be in two years more.”</p>

<p>“And Serge?”</p>

<p>“He is almost as old as I am.”</p>

<p>“How about Isaac?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Isaac is most twenty.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Sims,” said the missionary, turning to
the engineer, “I congratulate you on your crew.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the man, gruffly, “they’re a pretty
plucky lot of boys. We’ve been mighty short-handed,
though, since the cap’n took sick, and Martin died,
and my assistant was set ashore for mutiny, and I for
one am powerful glad to see another white man come
on board, even if he is a parson.”</p>

<p>Smiling at this equivocal compliment, the missionary
asked if he might visit the captain, and was
conducted by Phil to the sick man’s bedside. As they
came away he said to the young mate: “Your captain
is dangerously ill, and the sooner you get him to Anvik,
where there is a doctor, the better. Therefore I
would advise you to up anchor and make the run to-night,
especially as I fear the river may close before
morning.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>FLOATING ICE AND “CHY”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Happy to share his responsibility with the stranger
who had been so providentially sent to their relief,
Phil willingly agreed to his proposal, and ordered the
<i>Chimo</i> to be again got under way. The night was
clear, cold, and still; but there was no moon, and its
darkness was only dissipated in a measure by brilliant
starlight. This, however, was sufficient to disclose the
outline of the western bank, which the new pilot kept
always in sight. He seemed actually to be able to feel
his way up the mighty river, avoiding false channels
and sandbars as if by instinct, and never hesitating as
to which side of an island he ought to pass. Phil occupied
the pilot-house with him, and after a long silence
he exclaimed, admiringly, “You surely must
have been a steamboat man, sir, before you became a
missionary.”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed the other, “I never was on a river
steamer until I came out here, though as a boy I did
have some experience in running up and down Lake
Champlain, near which I lived.”</p>

<p>“In New York State?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“No; in Vermont, not very far from Burlington.
So, you see, I am a genuine Yankee.”</p>

<p>“I might have known it,” said Phil, “from your
handiness at all sorts of things. I wonder why it is
that, as a rule, the Yankee is such a Jack-at-all-trades?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is because he is generally taught by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
necessity in the shape of poverty,” replied the missionary;
“and even if he were not so taught at home, he
certainly would be out here, where a man must be able
to do nearly everything for himself or leave it undone.”</p>

<p>“Jalap Coombs was a Yankee,” meditated Phil,
“that is, when he didn’t feel that he was a subject, and
he could do more kinds of things than any one I ever
knew. How I wish he were with us at this very minute!
I don’t believe we could get into any scrape or
trouble that he wouldn’t manage to get us out of somehow.”</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” asked the missionary.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. That is, I hope not, though he might
as well be so far as we are concerned, for I don’t suppose
we shall ever see him again. We left him on Oonimak
Island, Serge and I did, and now I suppose he is
in Sitka or Victoria or San Francisco, or perhaps bound
for the other side of the world.”</p>

<p>Being thus started on the subject of Jalap Coombs,
Phil proceeded to give his new friend an account of
their recent adventures in Bering Sea, and of the
prominent part taken in them by the Yankee mate of
the sealer <i>Seamew</i>, in all of which the new-comer was
deeply interested. While Phil was in the midst of
an account of how Serge obtained fire from brimstone
and feathers, the second mate himself appeared to report
that their stock of fuel was nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>“Then we must stop at Makagamoot for a new
supply,” said the missionary pilot, promptly, “though
I fear we may have trouble in getting the natives to
turn out at this time of night; still, with your permission,
Captain Ryder, I think we would better try it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” agreed Phil; and so the <i>Chimo</i>, being
somewhere in the vicinity of the invisible Eskimo
settlement at that very moment, was headed for the
west bank of the river. Her whistle was sounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
vigorously at short intervals, to attract attention, and
in a few minutes her crew had the satisfaction of seeing
a glow of fire-light on the beach not more than a
mile ahead. At the same time there came an ominous
crunching of ice, and all hands instantly realized that
inshore the river was already frozen over. The ice
was not yet thick enough to stop them, though it
materially impeded their progress; they finally succeeded
in reaching the bank.</p>

<p>At first the few sleepy natives who came, out of
curiosity, to witness the unusual sight of a steamboat
at that time of night and thus late in the season, were
disinclined to do any work before morning; but the
appearance among them of the missionary, and a few
words from him, produced a magical change in their
attitude. Five minutes later a long line containing
every able-bodied man in the settlement was formed
from the steamer to the wood-pile, and a steady stream
of cord-wood sticks, passed from hand to hand, was
flowing aboard.</p>

<p>Within half an hour every inch of wood room was
filled, the natives were made glad by double the pay
they had ever received for a similar amount of work,
and the <i>Chimo</i> was backing out of the channel she
had made for herself towards open water.</p>

<p>Only fifteen miles now lay between her and Anvik,
and though the night had grown bitterly cold, her pilot
held out hopes that they might still make the run
without being nipped in the rapidly forming ice.</p>

<p>Under every pound of steam that her boiler would
bear, the sturdy little craft quivered to her very keel
as she ploughed through the black waters, grinding
the floating ice-cakes beneath her bow, tossing them
to one side, or beating them to fragments with her
powerful wheel. Leaving the missionary alone in the
pilot-house, Phil worked with Serge and Isaac at heaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
wood into the roaring furnace. In face of its
fervent heat it was hard for them to realize that the
night was cold, and much less that the mercury stood
close to zero.</p>

<p>But the silent figure grasping the frigid spokes up
in the pilot-house knew it, and his anxiety increased
with each slow-dragging hour. Was it indeed too
late to reach a safe winter haven? Had he been too
officious and self-confident? He almost feared so,
and said as much to Phil when the young mate
came up to inquire how many miles more they had
to go.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, sir,” cried the lad, with all his old
cheery confidence fully restored. “Why, you not
only rescued us from a regular slough of despond,
but from the imminent danger of being frozen in
where we were as well. If you hadn’t come along we
should certainly have stayed there until morning, in
which case it is plain enough now that the <i>Chimo</i>
would have gone no farther this winter. Now you
have at least brought us within reach of safety even
if we shouldn’t move another yard, and you have
lifted a mighty heavy load of anxiety from my shoulders,
I can tell you. But aren’t we nearly there, sir?
It seems as though we had come fifty miles instead of
fifteen since we took on that wood.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if it were daylight, which it soon will be,
we could see Anvik now. When we have made a
couple more miles I shall head her into the ice. In
the meantime I wish you would ask Serge to make me
a pot of his hottest <em>chy</em>, for I am nearly perished with
the cold.”</p>

<p>“A pot of what?” asked Phil, thinking he must
have misunderstood the word.</p>

<p>“Of <em>chy</em>. Tell him a <em>chy peet</em> is what I want. He
will understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir! <em>Chy</em> it is, and you shall have it if
there’s a drop to be found aboard the boat.”</p>

<p>Serge laughed at the order, and hastened to fill it;
while Phil followed him, curious to see what he would
make.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s tea you are putting into the pot!” he
exclaimed, a few minutes later.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Serge; “<em>chy</em> is tea, and tea is
<em>chy</em>, and the teapot is <em>chynik</em>, and <em>chy peet</em> is a lunch
of tea and bread. So there’s a lesson in Russian that
I know you won’t forget in a hurry. Now, if you will
carry it up to him I will get back to the furnace door,
for poor Isaac is just about used up.”</p>

<p>So the young captain acted as steward, and then,
taking the wheel while his guest drank cup after cup
of the scalding liquid, became quartermaster, and was
finally restored to his original rank by having the
missionary ask his permission to send the <i>Chimo</i> into
the ice. “It may injure the hull somewhat,” he said,
“and probably will; but we’ve either got to risk it or
leave her to winter out here in the middle of the river;
for we are abreast of Anvik now. You will see the
houses in a few minutes, for dawn is close at hand.”</p>

<p>“Of course we must put her into the ice, and rush
her just as far as she will go,” answered Phil. “We
can afford to damage her hull to a very considerable
extent better than we can afford to leave her out here
to be crushed by the spring break-up of the ice.”</p>

<p>So in the first flush of morning the brave little boat
was headed towards the western bank, and began directly
to crash through the thin ice fringing the
channel. For some distance she cut her way as
though it had been so much window-glass; then her
progress became slower and slower, until finally she
came to a dead stop, though the big wheel was still
lashing the turbid waters into foam behind her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop her! Back her! Stop her! Go ahead, full
speed!” were the orders tapped out on the engine-room
gong, and rushing at the ice with gathered headway,
the <i>Chimo</i> crashed her way through it for a
hundred yards farther. Again she was backed, and
again charged the enemy with furious impetus. This
time the shock was terrific, though she did not gain
more than half the former distance. Again and again
was the attack repeated, until finally she gained barely
a length.</p>

<p>With the next shock the steamer climbed the ice,
and ran nearly half her length out of water before the
barrier broke with her weight, and set her once more
afloat.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” said Phil, quietly. “We don’t dare
try that again. If we did we’d probably open every
seam in her, even if we didn’t break her back. So
that’s all we can do, and here is where the <i>Chimo</i> will
have to lie for the winter. It’s too bad, though, for
we aren’t more than a quarter of a mile from shore.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about lying here all winter,” replied
the missionary. “I don’t like it myself, and if you
would rather have the boat close to the bank I guess
we can manage to put her there.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“You wait here and get breakfast while I go ashore
on the ice. I won’t be gone more than an hour, and
when I come back I’ll tell you,” was the reply. “I
shall bring the doctor with me, too.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE “CHIMO” GOES INTO WINTER-QUARTERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>While Phil watched the departing missionary, who
was making his way cautiously over the newly-formed
ice, the late-rising sun appeared above the southeastern
horizon, gilding a cross surmounting the tower of
a little log-church pleasantly located on a high bluff.
Back of it rose the dark-green wall of a spruce forest,
while about it were clustered a number of low
but very substantial and comfortable-looking log-houses.
Near the beach at the foot of the bluff stood
an Indian village of huts whose roofs bristled with
poles. In each one was left a square hole for the
egress of smoke from the open fire built on an earthen
floor beneath.</p>

<p>Scattered about in picturesque but hopeless confusion
were long ranges of pole frames for drying fish, many
little log-houses mounted on stilts and looking like
dove-cots, the use of which Phil could not imagine,
fish-traps, boats, sledges, and everywhere dozens of
yelping, prowling, fighting, or sleeping dogs. Besides
these things Phil could see what appeared to be the
black chimney-stack of some kind of a mill.</p>

<p>Suddenly a flag was run to the top of a tall pole on
top of the bluff, and as the Stars and Stripes streamed
out bravely in the cold wind a rattling volley of musketry
rang forth its loud note of welcome from the
Indian village. To this Phil responded by a vigorous
salute from the <i>Chimo’s</i> whistle. Then, so utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
weary from overwork, excitement, and loss of sleep
that merely to move required a strong effort of will,
he left the pilot-house and went below. He found
Serge at the captain’s bedside administering a bowl of
broth and telling the sick man of the events of the
night.</p>

<p>As Phil entered, Gerald Hamer’s eyes rested on him
with such an expression of gratitude as the former
will never forget. “I thank you two boys,” he said,
weakly, “more than I can ever tell. To you I owe not
only my life, but whatever it holds of value, and—”
Here his voice failed him, and Serge bade him not to
attempt another word.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” added Phil, “for you don’t owe us
one cent’s worth of thanks, Mr. Hamer. To the end
of our lives we shall always be in your debt, and in
bringing you up the river to this point we have used
your boat to bring ourselves as well. So—well, that’s
all there is to it, anyway; and now if you will only
hurry up and get well we shall appreciate that more
than all the thanks in the world.”</p>

<p>Then Serge left, and Phil, slipping into his vacated
chair, almost instantly fell into a sleep so profound that
it is doubtful if a boiler explosion or an earthquake
could have aroused him.</p>

<p>An hour or so later he was in the midst of a very
perplexing dream, in which he seemed to be recovering
from an illness, and the old family physician at his
bedside kept changing into a young woman. While
in the form of an old man he said, “Yes, there are the
two captains, both evidently sound asleep, and no wonder.
This is Captain Hamer, who would have died
long ago but for the devoted care of the two lads, and
this is Captain Ryder, who brought the boat up the
river in the face of all obstacles.”</p>

<p>Then, presto! the old doctor changed into a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
woman, who said, “Poor boy, I don’t wonder that he
has fallen asleep, and I only hope he isn’t in for a spell
of illness. He certainly appears feverish.”</p>

<p>With this a soft hand was laid on Phil’s forehead,
and he opened his eyes to find his dream so far a reality
that there actually was a young woman bending over
him, and wearing an expression of anxiety on her pleasant
face. Behind her stood the missionary.</p>

<p>She stepped back as she saw that Phil was awake,
and the poor boy, recalling vividly his dishevelled appearance,
struggled to his feet with a crimson face.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were going to bring ladies to
see us,” he said in a reproachful tone to his companion
of the night. “In fact, I didn’t know there was a lady
within a thousand miles of here. I’m sure you didn’t
mention the fact. You only said you were going to
fetch the doctor.”</p>

<p>“And so I have,” laughed the missionary, “for this
young lady is <a href="#i_fp042">our doctor</a>, and a most excellent one she
is, too, I can assure you. She was just saying that you
didn’t look at all well, and wondering if you were going
to have the measles.”</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_42">ARRIVAL OF THE DOCTOR</a></div>
</div>

<p>“I had ’em long ago,” answered the lad, “and I never
felt better in my life. I was a bit sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Which isn’t surprising after all you have recently
undergone,” remarked the doctor, with a winning smile
that served to establish friendly relations between them
at once. “You see, we have already heard of your
brave struggle against our unruly river, and that you
may be prepared for them I will tell you at once that
there are two more ladies at the station who are quite
anxious to meet the hero of so many adventures.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped poor Phil, who had never before been
called a hero.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you needn’t look so alarmed. They aren’t
half so formidable as I am, for they haven’t the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of ordering people to do things that I obtained
with my diploma.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to order me to do things?” asked
Phil, with recovered self-possession.</p>

<p>“Indeed I am; for as a doctor I dare issue orders
even to a steamboat captain,” laughed the young woman.
“I am going to order you to take sleep in big doses.
It is a famous remedy in this country, for our nights
are already seventeen hours long, and steadily lengthening.
But, joking aside, I want to congratulate you,
Mr. Ryder, on your skilful care of this patient, whose
life has been undoubtedly saved by your success in
keeping him warm. Although he is still a very sick
man, I believe the crisis is past, and that with the nursing
he can have on shore he will pull through all
right.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad to hear it,” said Phil, “but I’m
puzzled to know how we are to get him ashore. I
shouldn’t think it would do to carry him over the ice
in the face of the wind that is blowing.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“So we have made arrangements to carry him in
this very boat,” said the missionary, “and if you care
to step outside for a moment you can see how we propose
to accomplish it.”</p>

<p>Phil had been wondering at the sound of many
voices and busy labor that came from without, but
as he gained the deck he comprehended the missionary’s
plan at a glance. Some fifty native men and
boys, directed by a white man, were hard at work with
axes, ice-chisels, poles, and other implements opening
a channel the full width of the <i>Chimo</i> from where
she lay to the shore. As fast as a cake was loosened
it was shoved under the solid ice on the down-stream
side, and already a passage was opened for one-third
of the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is a capital idea!” exclaimed Phil, “and one
that I don’t believe I should have thought of. Even if I
had I am afraid we couldn’t have carried it out by ourselves,
nor do I believe we could have induced those natives
to work for us as they seem willing to do for you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” replied the missionary; “but I think
they are fond of me, for when I explained to them how
much I owed to my timely meeting with you last evening
they seemed only too glad of a chance to return
the favor.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t realize that you owed anything to us,”
meditated Phil. “In fact, I thought we had been indebted
to you for favors ever since our fortunate meeting.
But it seems as though most every one was
in debt to some one else for assistance in times of
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my boy,” replied the missionary, “that is one
of the fundamental principles of human life. From
the moment we enter this world until we leave it we
are dependent upon others for everything we possess, including
life itself. Wherefore it becomes us to render
unto our fellows such services as we may, promptly and
cheerfully. But here comes Serge, and I am sure he
is going to say that breakfast is ready.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Serge, “I am, and I should have said
it long ago only Phil was so sound asleep that I couldn’t
wake him without disturbing the captain. But now,
if he is hungry—”</p>

<p>“If I am hungry!” cried Phil. “I honestly believe
it was only my ravenous hunger that put me to sleep.
Will you join us, sir?”</p>

<p>“I was only waiting for an invitation,” replied the
missionary, with a smile, “for I didn’t stop ashore long
enough to get anything to eat. Nor do I believe the
doctor has had her breakfast; so if Serge doesn’t mind
having a lady at his table—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“A lady?” stammered Serge, in dismay, and gazing
wildly about him. “Is there one on board?”</p>

<p>“There certainly is,” laughed the missionary, “and
from what she has heard of your culinary skill she is
most anxious to test it.”</p>

<p>A minute later they were all gathered about the
<i>Chimo’s</i> mess-table, and the doctor was winning golden
opinions by her judiciously bestowed compliments.
Even gruff Mr. Sims was induced to smile by her praise
of his polished engine, which she declared outshone any
yet seen on the Yukon; while Isaac was told that the
mission saw-mill was so frightfully out of order that
the man of all men most needed there at that moment
was a millwright.</p>

<p>The pleasant meal was hardly finished when a great
shout from outside announced the completion of the
canal. Then, with Phil at the wheel, while the missionary
and the doctor occupied the pilot-house with him,
and with flags at half-mast for the dead man in her
cabin, the stanch little <i>Chimo</i> steamed slowly up the
narrow channel to the berth she was to occupy for the
next eight months. As she reached it the mission flag
was dipped in salute, and then hoisted to half-mast in
sympathy with her sorrow.</p>

<p>So the eventful voyage of four hundred miles from
St. Michaels was ended; and, thanks to the lads whom
Gerald Hamer had rescued from the cruel waters of
Bering Sea, he and his property were now moored in a
safe haven. And it was none too soon, for that very
night the cold was so intense that the Yukon was
frozen from bank to bank.</p>

<p>But Phil did not care, nor did Serge. They had
reached the goal towards which they had set their
faces with such sturdy determination, and for them
neither cold nor storm had any present terrors.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>LIFE AT AN ARCTIC MISSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The first thing to be undertaken after the <i>Chimo</i>
was safely moored in her snug berth was the removal
of Gerald Hamer to the little log hospital that was the
pride of the doctor’s heart. This was accomplished
without any danger from exposure by means of a canvas-covered
litter especially constructed for the occasion.
To be undressed for the first time in many days,
given a warm bath, and placed in a bed that was actually
spread with sheets was to be so “lapped in luxury”
that, as the sick man whispered to Phil, any one who
wouldn’t get well under such conditions deserved to die.</p>

<p>The second duty was the burial of poor Martin, for
whom a grave was already prepared in the quaint little
cemetery of the settlement. The rude coffin was
borne by his late shipmates, and the entire community
of Anvik, natives as well as whites, followed the body
to its place of final rest. Never had Phil been so impressed
with the solemn beauty of the Episcopal service
as when he listened to its grand utterances amid
the surroundings of that wild Northern land. The
low-hanging sun, the moan of the wintry wind through
the sombre forest, the attentive groups of dark-skinned
natives, the mighty river rolling its tawny flood at
their feet, and the encircling solitudes, vast, silent, and
mysterious, centring at that simple grave, combined to
form a picture that none of its spectators will ever
forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>When all was over the living left the dead with
the dead, and returned to their homes. Even Phil and
Serge declined, on the plea of utter weariness, the proffered
hospitality of the mission for that night, and
went back to their own quarters aboard the <i>Chimo</i>,
where for the next twenty-four hours they slept almost
without intermission.</p>

<p>Then they were ready for anything, and when they
again presented themselves at the mission, clad in new
suits taken from the steamer’s ample trade stock, the
ladies found it difficult to realize that these handsome,
wide-awake young fellows were the same who, heavy-eyed,
unkempt, and ready to drop with exhaustion, had
brought the <i>Chimo</i> to port two days before.</p>

<p>Nor did it seem to the boys that they could be in
the same place, for while they slept the river had frozen
completely over, a fall of snow had infolded all nature
in its spotless mantle, and now the whole world lay
sparkling in unclouded sunlight. If they were amazed
at the change in the aspect of the mission they were
also delighted with the missionary’s house, which they
now entered for the first time. Not since leaving
far-away New London had either of them seen anything
to compare with the prettiness and comfort displayed
in this wilderness house on the verge of arctic
Alaska.</p>

<p>There were books, magazines, and pictures, rugs and
potted ferns, a small organ, luxurious divans and easy-chairs,
a museum of native curios, and many other noticeable
objects of use or ornament. In an immense
fireplace a cheery blaze roared and crackled, and before
it a fine big cat purred forth his content. In the eyes of
the boys there was nothing lacking to the perfection of
this interior. And yet it was all very simple and inexpensive.
Most of the furniture was home-made, the
divans were cushioned with feathers from native wild-fowl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and the rugs were trophies from neighboring
forest or waters.</p>

<p>The missionary’s family consisted of his wife, the
doctor, a young lady teacher, and a white man who
had charge of the saw-mill. Besides these there were
a few bright native boys and girls who were under
special instruction.</p>

<p>While the lads chatted with the ladies and marvelled
at their surroundings one of the native boys was seen
approaching the house, whereupon its mistress, saying,
“Ah! there comes the mail,” went to the door. “Nothing
but the paper,” she announced on her return; “but
we shall at least learn the latest news.”</p>

<p>“I had no idea that you had a mail service in the
winter,” remarked Phil, innocently, “nor that there
was a paper published in this part of the world.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no! It isn’t published here,” laughed the
missionary’s wife. “It is a New York paper, and only
a weekly at that; still it is better than none, and being
of this week’s date its news is quite recent. See?”</p>

<p>So saying she held out the paper for Phil’s inspection,
and to his amazement he saw that it was indeed a
New York paper bearing the date of October 20th.
Not until Serge, to whom this harmless deception was
an old story, broke out with the laughter he could no
longer restrain did it flash into Phil’s mind that the
paper was a year old, and then he could have thumped
himself for his stupidity.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained the missionary’s wife, “we
only receive mail once or twice a year, and then we get
such a quantity of papers that we cannot possibly read
them all at once. So we lay them aside, and have them
delivered one at a time on their regular dates, by which
means we receive two or three newspapers every week
during the year.”</p>

<p>“What a capital idea!” exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it? And it is such good training for the boys,
who are allowed to act as postmen. Then, too, we use
the papers in school in place of reading-books, and so
have fresh topics with which to interest the scholars
every week. On this account our reading-class is so
popular that it has nearly outgrown the capacity of
our school-room; but, thanks to Captain Hamer, we are
to have a new one in the spring.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Is he going to build you one?”</p>

<p>“He is already having it built, and it is to serve as
your winter-quarters so long as you remain with us, after
which it is to be presented to the mission.”</p>

<p>This was so interesting a bit of news that the boys
must visit the hospital at once and learn what plans the
leader of their expedition had made. They found him
so far recovered as already to take an interest in his
surroundings, and able to talk freely with them. He
told them that with a view to the future needs of the
school the new building was to be forty feet long by
twenty wide, though for the sake of present warmth
and comfort it was to be divided into several small
sleeping-rooms, a large living-room for the use of the
<i>Chimo’s</i> crew, and a store-room for such goods as it
was deemed best to remove from the steamer for safer
keeping.</p>

<p>“In it,” explained the captain, “we will make ourselves
as comfortable as possible for the winter, and in
the spring we will push on for the diggings. With
the four hundred miles’ start we have got, thanks to
you boys, we ought to reach them in time to do a rattling
business before the company’s boats get there.”</p>

<p>“But how about going out by way of Chilkat for
your next year’s supply of goods?” queried Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, that plan must be given up, of course, and I
must make up my mind to sacrifice a year’s business
for the fun I’ve had with the measles. The trip from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
here in the dead of winter would be a tough one for
the strongest of men, for it must be all of two thousand
miles. It will easily take me the rest of the winter
to regain strength enough to go on with the boat
in the spring, so there’s no use thinking of that trip
now. I’ll manage to send you boys out somehow next
summer, which is the nearest I can come to keeping my
contract with you. In the meantime, while I am sorry
for your disappointment, I am very glad of your company
and services.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think, then, that it would be possible
for us to go out this winter by way of Forty Mile and
the coast and make our way to the Sound, or even to
San Francisco, and order your goods for you?” suggested
Phil, in whose mind this wild scheme had suddenly
assumed shape.</p>

<p>“You two inexperienced boys!” exclaimed the captain,
amazed at the audacity of the proposition. “Certainly
not. Why, I don’t believe either of you knows
how to use snow-shoes, or to drive a team of dogs, or has
the least idea of what fifty below zero means.”</p>

<p>“I think I know,” said Serge.</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“All of those things,” replied the young Russo-American.</p>

<p>“You know more than I do, then, or ever expect to,
for I have never driven a dog-team. As for Phil here,
I am certain that he knows nothing about any one of
the three.”</p>

<p>“I believe I could learn,” said the boy from New
London, “and I know I’d be glad of the chance.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can study those things right here, and
while you are learning what fifty below zero means
you’ll be glad enough to have a well-warmed house
near by in which to study the results of your lesson.
You’ll find plenty to occupy your time in this immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
vicinity for the next few months. So don’t think
any more of the crazy scheme you have just proposed,
for I can’t possibly give my consent to it. If I should
thus lose sight of you I should spend the rest of my
days in mortal terror of meeting Mr. John Ryder and
having him demand to know what I had done with his
boy. Now I shall have to ask you to leave me for a
while, as I am too tired to talk any more.”</p>

<p>As soon as the boys were outside Phil asked, “How
do you drive dogs, Serge? Do you have lines to each
one, or only to the leader?”</p>

<p>“You don’t drive them with lines at all,” laughed
the other. “Nor do you go near them. You sometimes
run beside the sledge, but generally behind it, so
as to push on the handle-bar over obstructions, or to
hang on and hold back in going down steep places.
From there you talk to the dogs, and encourage them
with a whip of walrus-hide or seal-skin that has a
handle about sixteen inches long and a lash of about
eighteen feet. To produce the slightest effect on your
team you must be able to crack that lash with a report
like a pistol-shot in either ear of any dog, or to fleck
any one of them on any designated part of the body.
You must also learn the language that your dogs are
accustomed to, for they will pay no attention to any
other.”</p>

<p>“And are snow-shoes a necessity?”</p>

<p>“Certainly they are, for without them you would
often sink out of sight in drifts, while even in soft
snow of moderate depth they are indispensable.”</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Phil, “it seems as though one had
to learn a great deal before he can travel far in this
country; but I suppose if others have, I can. So let’s
go and borrow a pair of snow-shoes and have a lesson
at once. I suppose I might as well begin the Eskimo
whip-practice and dog-language, too; for with such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
long journey ahead of us we mustn’t waste any more
time than is absolutely necessary on preliminaries.”</p>

<p>“What long journey?” asked Serge.</p>

<p>“Our journey up the river to Forty Mile, and so on
to Chilkat, of course. You didn’t imagine we were going
to loaf here all winter, did you?”</p>

<p>“But the captain won’t give his consent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll manage that. Besides, we’ve got to get
to Sitka some time, you know, or our parents will be
getting anxious about us.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>PHIL’S ESKIMO MILITIA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Phil and Serge dropped very easily into the life
of the mission, and quickly became interested in its
work. The missionary had always found more or less
trouble with the older Indian boys, who were almost
ready to take their place in the tribe as hunters, and
so felt themselves rather above going to school with
the children. When Phil learned of this difficulty he
conceived a plan for overcoming it, which, with the
missionary’s consent, he at once proceeded to put into
execution. It was nothing more nor less than to form
the unruly boys into a military company. He had been
an officer in his own school company at New London,
and even Serge had become fairly well drilled during
the year he had spent there.</p>

<p>Phil and Serge had already formed the acquaintance
of an intelligent young Indian named Chitsah, son of
Kurilla, who had once been in the employ of an American
exploring party, from whom he had gained a fair
knowledge of English.</p>

<p>Through Chitsah, therefore, Phil issued an invitation
to all the Indian lads between the ages of twelve
and eighteen to meet him and Serge in the large
school-room, which was cleared of its furniture for the
purpose, that very evening, as he wanted to teach them
a new game. About one dozen boys accepted this invitation,
and a disreputable, slouchy appearing lot they
were, all clad in cast-off or well-worn garments of civilization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and looking as though half ashamed of being
there. As Phil afterwards said, he expected each moment
to see them become panic-stricken and make a
break for the door.</p>

<p>By the aid of Serge and Chitsah, who acted as interpreters,
Phil explained that the new game was called
“soldiers.” He said that all who wanted to join his
company and come to that place three nights of the
week for drill might do so, provided each would first
make for himself a wooden gun like the one he had
prepared that day, and which he now showed them.
After a while they would give an exhibition drill to
which all their friends should be invited, but in the
meantime everything that took place at their meetings
was to be kept secret from outsiders. Then the young
drill-master put Serge through the manual of arms
and a few marching movements to illustrate his meaning.</p>

<p>The boys quickly comprehended the idea, and were
charmed with it. Some of them began instinctively
to stand straight and throw back their shoulders in
imitation of Serge. When Phil ranged them in a line
toeing a chalk-mark drawn across the floor, and then,
stepping back a few paces, called out, “’Tention!”
every one of them assumed an attitude bearing some
resemblance to that of a soldier, and stood motionless.
Then Phil pinned a band of scarlet cloth about the left
sleeve of the largest boy, who was known as Big Sidorka,
and told him he might wear it for one week,
after which it would be given to whichever one of
the company the others should decide to be the best
drilled.</p>

<p>The next evening twenty boys appeared, and every
one brought with him a wooden gun, all neatly and
some beautifully made. At this meeting they were
given their permanent positions in the ranks, taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to count “fours” at the word of command, to hold
themselves erect, to “carry” and to “shoulder” arms.
They were also given to understand that the company
was now full, and, until after the exhibition drill, no
more members would be admitted. This at once gave
membership a value that made it seem very desirable.</p>

<p>On this occasion, after the drill was over, Serge produced
a number of illustrated books and papers containing
pictures of soldiers, the meaning of which he
explained with such success as to fully arouse the interest
of his dusky audience. As a result of this experiment
the young Russo-American, who had worked
so bravely for his own education, found himself within
a week teaching an enthusiastic reading-class, in
which every member of Phil’s military company was a
willing scholar.</p>

<p>The missionary was jubilant over these successes,
and declared that with a dozen such helpers as Phil
and Serge he could have every Indian on the Yukon
in school within one year.</p>

<p>In the meantime our lads were not neglectful of
their own affairs. With every able-bodied Indian procurable
enlisted in the work, the new building was completed
by the end of the first week, and for some days
the <i>Chimo’s</i> crew found ample occupation in furnishing
and storing it. Then, too, under instructions from
Serge, Chitsah, or Kurilla, Phil spent every spare moment
of daylight in learning the art of snow-shoeing,
mastering the terrible Eskimo whip, and acquiring a
vocabulary of dog-language.</p>

<p>He got many a tumble on his snow-shoes, and took
ludicrous “headers” into many a deep drift, where he
would flounder helplessly until rescued by some of the
delighted spectators of his mishaps. The long whip,
too, tried its best to strangle him by winding in snaky
coils about his neck, or to tangle itself in bewildering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
knots around his legs. As for his vocabulary, it was
enough to provoke laughter in the most sedate of
sledge dogs, and created uproarious mirth among the
human occupants of the Indian village. In spite of all
difficulties, Phil persevered with unabated energy, until
gradually his feet and the snow-shoes began to
work together. He actually succeeded in cracking the
snake-like whip so that the sound could be heard, and
Kurilla’s fine team of bushy-tailed dogs began to prick
up their sharp ears understandingly when he addressed
them. Many a spin did he have on the river behind
this lively team, with Kurilla running beside the sledge
and cracking his mighty whip until its reports rattled
like a fire of musketry. When at length Phil was allowed
to run with the sledge instead of occupying it
as a passenger, and the entire control of the team was
intrusted to him, he felt prouder, as Jalap Coombs
used to say, than was becoming to a mere mortal man.</p>

<p>But his pride was quickly humbled, for ere they had
gone a mile the dogs discovered that they had no reason
to fear his whip, and that his unintelligible commands
might be treated with contemptuous indifference.
Suddenly Musky, the leader, who had a grudge
of long standing against Amook, one of the big steer-dogs,
turned like a flash and darted furiously at his
enemy. In an instant the whole team was rolling in a
confused mass of yelping, snarling, snapping, and biting
fur, with traces tangled in a thousand knots, sledge
going to smash, and pandemonium reigning generally.</p>

<p>Phil stood by in helpless consternation, and not until
Kurilla, running up in breathless haste, flung himself
bodily into the mêlée, did he have the faintest
hope that any dog would emerge alive from that savage
conflict.</p>

<p>Another time, as he thought he was meeting with complete
success in driving this same team, and was thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
enjoying a ride in the sledge, the dogs suddenly
stopped short and refused to go on. They sat on their
haunches, with wagging tails, and looked up at Phil
with pleased expressions, as though rejoicing over the
discovery that they needn’t work unless they chose.
And there they sat, in spite of all their driver’s efforts
to move them, until he was in despair, when with equal
suddenness they sprang up and dashed away home
with the empty sledge, leaving him to follow on foot
as best he might.</p>

<p>His first real journey by dog-sledge was to the Eskimo
village of Makagamoot, fifteen miles down the river,
and was taken in company with the missionary,
who was accustomed to visit this place once a month.
They went in two sledges, with Chitsah as runner, and
Phil took with him a small lot of goods. For these
Gerald Hamer wished him to procure several suits of
fur clothing, in making which the Eskimos greatly excel
their Indian neighbors.</p>

<p>While the entire coast of Alaska north of the great
peninsula is inhabited by Eskimos, they never penetrate
far into the interior, and only for short distances
along the principal rivers. Nor do the Indians of the
interior ever occupy the coast territory. Thus in the
present case Makagamoot was the last wholly Eskimo
settlement, and Anvik the first in which Indians predominated,
on the Yukon.</p>

<p>Makagamoot was a much more thrifty village than its
next neighbor, though at first sight its eight or ten large
houses looked only like so many great inverted bowls
or hillocks of snow. These winter residences are in a
great part below the surface of the ground, where they
are neatly lined with wood or whalebone, and are extremely
comfortable after their fashion. Thus only
their snow-covered roofs appear above the surface, and
in the centre of each is a square smoke-hole, that admits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
such daylight and outer air as find their way to
the interior. Access to these dwellings is gained by
means of tunnel-like approaches, through most of which
a man must crawl on hands and knees.</p>

<p>Back of the dwellings rose twenty or thirty of what
Phil had called log dove-cots, about six feet square
and high, mounted on ten-foot posts. He now knew
them to be provision caches or store-houses for the
smoked or dried fish and meat that furnished the entire
winter’s supply of food for the village. They are
thus constructed to insure their contents against the
horde of wolfish-looking dogs that ever gaze at them
with hungry longings. For the same reason all sledges
and skin-covered boats must be stored on scaffolds
erected for the purpose.</p>

<p>Phil and the missionary received an uproarious welcome,
emphasized by a great firing of guns, at this
quaint Eskimo village, and were conducted to the
kashga, or principal building, which is at once town-hall,
hotel, bath-house, and general assembly-room for
the settlement, as well as the winter residence of all
unmarried men.</p>

<p>So great was the heat in this place, so stifling its
atmosphere, and so horrible its odors, that poor Phil
gasped for breath on entering it. In vain did he attempt
to partake of some of the delicacies pressed
upon their guests by the hospitable natives. Raw
seal’s liver, strips of reindeer fat, dried fish, salmon
roe that had been kept for many weeks in a hole in
the ground, and caribou bones split so that the marrow
might be sucked from them, succeeded each other
in rapid succession. Phil was hungry, but not hungry
enough for any of these.</p>

<p>Nor could he force himself to remain in that terrible
atmosphere long enough to witness the wedding
of an Eskimo girl with a white man, a Russian ex-employé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of the old fur company, which was the first
duty the missionary was called upon to perform. The
mortified lad was sorry to thus disappoint his kind-hearted
and well-meaning entertainers; but there was
no help for it. So with swimming head and uneasy
stomach he made a break for the place of exit.</p>

<small>A SAD ROMANCE OF THE WILDERNESS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>From long familiarity with such interiors as that of
the kashga, and by a powerful exercise of will, the
missionary was able to remain long after poor Phil
had taken his departure, and also to partake of several
of the Eskimo dainties already mentioned. It was
largely by thus conforming in a measure to the ways
of the natives when with them that he had gained
their confidence and acquired the popularity that
paved the way for future usefulness. Still, it was
with a great sigh of relief and an eager inhaling of
fresh air that he finally emerged from that fetid
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Phil in the meantime had been amusing himself by
climbing the dome-like roofs of the houses, and obtaining
such glimpses as he might of their interiors
through the smoke-holes. He never gazed long
though, for the vile odors issuing from those apertures
always drove him away after a single glance below.</p>

<p>“How can human beings endure such vile, disgusting
smells?” he exclaimed, as the missionary rejoined
him.</p>

<p>“They are not vile and disgusting to them,” laughed
the other. “If noticed at all, they are extremely
agreeable. You must remember that the atmosphere
which you find so unendurable is that to which the
Eskimo has always been accustomed. As soon as he
is born his entire body is liberally smeared with rancid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
oil, and to the day of his death this coating of grease,
frequently renewed, affords his best protection against
cold and wet.</p>

<p>“His staples of food are fish and meat often in a
state of partial decay, and always odorous. Thus the
smells that to your unaccustomed nostrils are so offensive,
are to him associated with all that makes life
pleasant or even possible. At the same time he exhibits
the greatest aversion to those perfumes that
you consider most pleasing. A whiff of cologne will
make him ill, and flowers that to us are sweet-scented
are to him unendurable. Thus you see the sense of
smell, like all other senses, can be educated to adapt
itself to any conditions, and, happily for the Eskimo,
he finds nothing objectionable in the nauseous odors
surrounding him.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” reflected Phil, “for now I remember
that the Aleuts of the Pribyloff Islands could not understand
what I meant when I complained of the
awful stench rising from the decomposing bodies of
thousands of seals lying at their very doors.”</p>

<p>With the aid of the missionary and Chitsah, Phil
traded off the small stock of goods he had brought
with him for half a dozen parkas, or outer garments,
made from reindeer-skin with the hair still attached,
as many pairs of winter boots, and a number of other
articles made from seal-skin. Each of the parkas
had a hood at the back, which could be drawn up over
the head. The edge of this hood was trimmed with
wolf-skin taken from the back, where the hair is longest.
When the hood is in use these long hairs surround
the wearer’s face with a bristling fringe that
affords a surprising amount of protection from driving
snow and icy winds.</p>

<p>The tarbossa, or Eskimo boots, were made of the
skin of reindeer legs on which the hair is short and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stiff, and were provided with soles of seal-skin, turned
up over toes and heels, where they are gathered in
little puckers that the native women chew or shape
with their teeth. The upper end of one of these
boots is tied about the wearer’s knee, while a second
set of thongs at the ankle holds it in place at that
point.</p>

<p>Besides these things, Phil purchased a number of
Eskimo wolf-traps, the cruel ingenuity and extreme
simplicity of which exceeded anything of the kind he
had ever seen. They were merely bits of stiff whalebone
about one foot long, with sharpened points, folded
into the smallest possible compass, and confined in
that position by a lashing of sinew. For use this
harmless-looking affair is thrust into a piece of meat,
which is frozen and thrown down on the snow. Mr.
Wolf swallows meat, trap and all, with such relish
that he at once searches for another bit just like it.
In the meantime the trap has begun its deadly work
in his stomach. Its sinew lashing softens, weakens,
and finally breaks under the steady strain of the compressed
whalebone. Thus released the bone springs
into its original shape, thrusts its sharp points into the
wolf’s vitals, and often kills him instantly. If not at
once, death ensues in a very short time, and when the
thrifty Eskimo cuts up his wolf he generally recovers
his trap and prepares it to be set again.</p>

<p>The sledge-party from Anvik had started from
there before daylight of that morning with a view to
returning the same night. So as soon as the missionary
had visited every house in Makagamoot and Phil
had concluded his trading, the dogs, which Chitsah
had been obliged to guard all this time from an overwhelming
onslaught by their Eskimo cousins, were
headed homeward, and the return journey was begun.
Chitsah drove the leading sledge, which was laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
with the several hundred pounds of dried fish that the
missionary had received as a wedding-fee, the missionary
drove the other, which bore Phil’s purchases, and
the Yankee lad trudged beside him.</p>

<p>“Are you often called on to marry two people of
different races?” asked the latter, who was thinking
over the events of their recent visit.</p>

<p>“No, not often; though it is not uncommon for
white men, who have become permanent settlers in the
country, to marry native women, and I once married a
Chinese man to an Eskimo girl. My strangest experience
in that line, though, was gained some years ago,
when I first came to this country. Wishing to familiarize
myself with the entire valley, I took a trip on
the company’s steamer to the head of navigation. We
stopped to trade at every Indian camp, and at one of
these, near Fort Yukon, a couple came on board to get
married. The man was a tall, good-looking fellow,
but a full-blooded Cree Indian, from the distant interior.
His companion was also in Indian costume, but
the moment I looked at her face I saw, to my amazement,
that she was a white girl. She was quite young,
but had the saddest face I think I ever saw. I remonstrated
with her against the step she proposed to take,
but in a perfectly calm voice, and speaking most excellent
English, though with a Scotch accent, she assured
me that she was well aware of what she was
about to do, and that it was her firm resolve to marry
the Indian who stood beside her. Both he and she
gave the name of McLeod, and under that name I married
them.</p>

<p>“After the ceremony was over she told me her story.
It seems that, in spite of her fair skin, she was a half-breed
daughter of the Scotch factor of a Hudson Bay
trading-post and his Indian wife. When she was
thirteen years old her father sent her to Scotland to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
be educated. She made the long trip by canoe and
sledge from the distant post where she was born to
York Factory, on Hudson Bay, in safety, and there
took passage in the company’s annual ship for London.
From there she was sent to Edinburgh, where for five
years she lived with relatives and attended school.
Then she received a note of recall from her father,
and was obliged to retrace the wearisome journey over
thousands of miles of sea and wilderness to her home
in the far Northwest. It was terrible for her to leave
the dear friends and pleasant associations of so many
years, and hardest of all to separate from the young
Scotchman who had won her heart and her promise to
marry him as soon as he should come to claim her in
her own home. While she returned to Hudson Bay
in a company’s ship, he was forced to travel by way of
New York and through the States.</p>

<p>“When the girl reached her home she immediately
told her parents of her engagement, and that her lover
was even then on his way to marry her. To her dismay
her father flew into a violent rage, informed her
that he had already selected a husband for her in the
person of one of the company’s employés stationed at
Fort Liard, and declared that she must marry him at
once. In vain did the girl plead with him and endeavor
to change his cruel determination, and in vain
did the mother take her part. The tyrannical father
only grew the more obstinate, and when, after months
of weary wanderings, the Scotch lover appeared at the
fort, he was driven from it with bitter words. He was
not allowed to see, or even communicate with, the
girl, but was ordered to leave the country at once.</p>

<p>“There was nothing to do but obey. The factor was
also the only magistrate of a vast region, and ruled it
with a rod of iron. None could dwell within his jurisdiction
without his knowledge, none obtain employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
without his consent. The forts held all the necessaries
of life, and none could be purchased elsewhere.
A band of Indians was ordered to convey the
unfortunate youth several hundreds of miles away and
there leave him. This they did, but what afterwards
became of him I do not know.</p>

<p>“By some means the girl learned of her lover’s visit
to the fort, of his harsh reception, and of his cruel
banishment. The knowledge broke her heart. She
became dejected and miserable, and spent her days
in weeping. At this her father became so furious that
he sent for the man to whom he had promised her to
come and marry her at once. He furthermore upbraided
his daughter in the presence of all the employés
of the fort, and said such cruel things about
the man she loved that, declaring she could bear it no
longer, she ran out, mounted her pony, and fled to her
mother’s tribe. There she promised to marry a young
Indian who had long admired her, and at once set out
with his family for the Yukon, where they hoped to
find a priest. As it happened, I was the first whom
they encountered, and the result I have already told.”</p>

<p>“What became of them after that?” asked Phil,
who was deeply interested in this sad romance of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>“I do not know. They dared not return to the territory
governed by her father, and the last I heard of
them they were living by themselves somewhere on
the upper Yukon, where the man was making a precarious
livelihood by trapping. I tried to induce them
to come and make their home at the mission, but poor
Ellen McLeod answered that she should never again
dwell among people of her father’s race.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl,” sighed Phil, who had a very tender
heart for the troubles of others. “I wonder if we
should have any chance of meeting them if we took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
our trip up the river? By-the-way, sir, don’t you
think Serge and I might be trusted to make that trip
this winter?”</p>

<p>“I should not care to advise you to do it,” replied
the missionary, “knowing its dangers as I do. And
certainly you could not go without Captain Hamer’s
consent, for you would require a more expensive outfit
than any one save he could furnish.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” admitted Phil, ruefully, “but I
can’t help thinking something will turn up to make it
seem best to let us go.”</p>

<p>They were by this time nearing Anvik, and though
the sun had long since set, the river was flooded with
moonlight. All at once a dark figure darted out from
the shore and came running towards them. As it drew
near, Kurilla’s well-known voice shouted, breathlessly:</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp066">“Cap’n Phil’s fadder gone up river! Yaas, he
fadder!”</a></p>

<p>“My father!” cried Phil. “It can’t be. You must
be crazy, for my father is thousands of miles from
here.”</p>

<p>“True, all same. You fadder, yaas!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE BOYS CARRY THEIR POINT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Never in his life had Phil Ryder been more perplexed
than he was at the astonishing statement just
made by Kurilla. It was incredible that his father
should be in that country. Why should he be? There
had been barely time for him to receive the letter
sent out by Nikrik, and he could not possibly have
reached the Yukon Valley since then.</p>

<p>“How do you know it is my father?” he demanded
of the native. “Has he been here? Did you see
him? Why didn’t he wait until I came back?”</p>

<p>“Him no come. Him go up river. Me no see him.
You fadder, yaas.”</p>

<p>“What can the man mean?” asked Phil, in despair
of obtaining any intelligible explanation and turning
to the missionary for aid.</p>

<p>From that time until they reached the station, which
they found in a state of excitement over the news, the
missionary questioned Kurilla in his own tongue, and
by the time they were inside the house he had gleaned
all the information the Indian possessed.</p>

<p>“He says,” began the missionary, turning to his
eager audience, “that he obtained his news from a Nulato
Indian, who left St. Michaels only three days ago,
and came by way of the Divide and the Anvik River.
He is a friend of Kurilla, and spent a couple of hours
with him this morning, after which he continued his
journey. According to him, as understood by Kurilla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a schooner containing Phil’s father and another white
man reached the Redoubt soon after the <i>Chimo</i> left.
The other white man was sick, so that none of the
natives saw him; but Phil’s father spent his whole
time making inquiries of every one about the boys,
and where they had gone, what sort of a man they had
gone with, and what chance there was of overtaking
them.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid he did not receive a very flattering
description of the man they had gone with,” remarked
Gerald Hamer, who was by this time out of the hospital
and able to join the pleasant family circle.</p>

<p>“About that same time,” continued the missionary,
“the revenue-cutter <i>Bear</i> came down from the northward,
bringing the crew of a wrecked whaler, so that
for a while there were many white men and much confusion
at St. Michaels. Then both the <i>Bear</i> and the
schooner sailed away, taking most of the white men
with them, but Phil’s father stayed behind. By-and-by
news came from Nulato that the <i>Chimo</i> had passed
that point without stopping, on her way up the river.”</p>

<p>“Which is news indeed,” muttered Gerald Hamer,
“seeing that Nulato is a good one hundred and fifty
miles beyond here.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” laughed the missionary. “And, to cap
the climax, the same runner that brought that information
announced that you would undoubtedly be frozen
in before you had gone much farther, whereupon
Phil’s father began making preparations to follow
and overtake you by dog-sledges. He started the day
before our informant left the Redoubt, and was accompanied
by two other white men, though whether
one of them was he who also came on the schooner,
Kurilla did not find out. So there you have the whole
story as straight as it can be obtained; but, considering
the channels through which it has come, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
such an opportunity for errors that I should not be at
all surprised if a number had crept into it.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” admitted Phil, “though I can’t doubt that
my father has arrived in this part of the country, impossible
as it may seem, for surely no one else could
have any object in announcing himself as my father,
or going to such trouble in hunting me up. Nor can
I doubt that, having conceived some absurd notion
that I am likely to get into trouble, the dear old pop
has set forth on a wild-goose chase after me. I fancy
I can see him at this moment politely trying to breathe,
or to swallow raw seal, in some native hut, or careering
over the river behind a team of runaway dogs, or
wrestling with the intricacies of an Eskimo whip, or
having some of the other delightful experiences that
he is certain to encounter. There is one thing that
won’t bother him, though, and that is snow-shoeing,
for he learned that long ago in Canada.”</p>

<p>“How fond he must be of you!” said the missionary’s
wife.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, he is!” cried Phil. “And I of him,
for we are everything in the world to each other.”</p>

<p>“And how anxious he must be!” murmured the
teacher.</p>

<p>“I suppose so; though I don’t see why he should
be, for he taught me to take care of myself long ago.
I am beginning to get pretty anxious about him,
though, and it seems to me that it is clearly my duty
to organize a relief expedition at once and go in search
of him. What do you say to that, Serge?”</p>

<p>“I say I should feel exactly as you do if he were
my mother,” answered the lad from Sitka, who was
immediately afterwards covered with confusion by the
outburst of merriment that greeted his remark.</p>

<p>“I mean—” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Of course,” interrupted Phil, teasingly, “we understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
You mean that if my father were your
mother, in which case you and I would probably be
brother and sister, you would feel in duty bound to go
in search of him or her, as the case might be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you get out!” laughed Serge.</p>

<p>“The very thing I am proposing to do. And, really,
Captain Hamer, now that my father has appeared on
the scene, and gone up the river, I don’t see how you
can any longer have an excuse for refusing to let
Serge and me follow after him. If we don’t overtake
him this side of Forty Mile, we shall certainly find
him there. Then we can all go out together by way of
Chilkat, and I know that out of gratitude for your
kindness to me, if for no other reason, my father will
gladly undertake to place your order for goods in San
Francisco.”</p>

<p>“Your argument is certainly a strong one,” admitted
Gerald Hamer, hesitatingly, “and it really
begins to look as though you had gained your point
after all.”</p>

<p>“And we ought to start as quickly as we can,” urged
Phil, eagerly, “in order to relieve my father’s anxiety
as soon as possible, and also to prevent him from getting
lost, which, I am sure, any one is likely to do on
the Yukon. When it comes to procuring dogs for the
trip, I would advise you to buy Kurilla’s team, if possible,
for I give you my word they are far and away
the very best lot of haulers I have ever driven. As
for their feed, I was invited to a certain wedding to-day,
though I regret that I was forced to decline the
invitation, that resulted in a sledge-load of prime dog-fish—no,
I don’t mean that either, for they were salmon—which,
I believe, can be bought cheap.”</p>

<p>Thus rattling on and unhesitatingly offering advice
on all subjects connected with dog-sledging and snow-shoeing,
even going so far as to express the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that for their work Norwegian skis would be far better
than the ordinary snow-shoe of the country, Phil
succeeded within a few minutes in establishing the
fact that his long-cherished expedition was really to
be undertaken.</p>

<p>As he remarked in a low but exultant tone to Serge
after they had gone to bed that night: “Hurrah for
snow-shoes and sledges, old man! We have got them
at last, as I told you we would from the very beginning.”</p>

<p>And Serge, who was almost asleep, roused himself
sufficiently to reply: “What did you say? Oh yes, I
know. Hurrah! Good-night.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the Yankee lad disgustedly hurled a
pillow at him with such force as to effectually banish
sleep and provoke retaliation that resulted in Phil’s
bed coming down with a crash. Upon this its occupant
remarked that he always did despise civilized
beds anyhow, and that hemlock boughs in front of a
rousing camp-fire were good enough for him.</p>

<p>In the meantime some of the preliminaries of the
tremendous journey, to which the boys looked forward
with such delight and their elders with so many misgivings,
had been arranged that very evening. The
best obtainable map of the Yukon was studied, and
marked with such private information as was possessed
by the missionary.</p>

<p>“If you could only overtake them before reaching
the Tanana River,” he said, reflectively, “you might
cut off the great arctic bend of the Yukon, and save
several hundred miles by going up the former river,
crossing a divide to a branch of Forty Mile Creek, and
following it down to the camp at its mouth. I suppose,
though, they will have passed the Tanana long before
you get there, and so you will be obliged to follow the
great bend for fear of missing them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose so,” assented Phil, “but I don’t care.
The longer the trip the more fun we’ll have.”</p>

<p>“You will find it long enough before you get
through,” remarked Gerald Hamer, significantly.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” returned the irrepressible lad. “I like
to have enough of a good thing.”</p>

<p>An hour or more was devoted to making out a list
of the articles necessary for the trip. While from
then until the very time of departure Phil kept thinking
of and adding new items to this list, Serge was
kept equally busy in trying to reduce its length.</p>

<p>Before Kurilla was dismissed that evening both he
and his son Chitsah were engaged to accompany the
boys at least as far as Forty Mile, a distance of one
thousand miles, though beyond that point they would
not promise to go.</p>

<p>From Kurilla also Gerald Hamer agreed to purchase,
at his own price, his fine team of dogs, of
which bushy-tailed Musky was leader, big Amook and
Mint were steer-dogs, and Luvtuk and Shag completed
the nimble-footed quintet. This was hereafter
to be known as Phil’s team, for, having already had
some experience in driving them, it was believed that
he could manage them better than dogs unaccustomed
to his astonishing pronunciation of the native words
of command. Kurilla was to bring them to him the
very next morning to be fed, for in dog-sledging it is
a rule that every driver shall feed his own team, in
order to win their regard and persuade them that he
is not an unmitigated evil.</p>

<p>The season was now late November, and though the
morrow was Thanksgiving day, or believed to be such
in absence of any proclamation to that effect, it was to
be devoted to preparations, and the start was to be
made at sunrise of the following morning. Therefore
Phil’s last words of the night were:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am dead tired, old man, but I want you to wake
me early all the same, for I shall have only one day
in which to feed my dogs and teach them to know
me.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>PHIL FEEDS HIS DOGS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It did not seem to Phil that he had any more than
closed his eyes before he was awakened by such a babel
of yelps and barkings as notified him that further
sleep was out of the question, and also that his dogs
were waiting to be fed. Hearty imprecations showered
on the heads of the vociferous team from the direction
of Mr. Sims’s room, and threats to treat them
to a dose of duck-shot, so hastened Phil’s movements
that in a few seconds he had slipped on his seal-skin
boots and fur parka, and was outside in the stinging
cold. There in the moonlight stood Kurilla, with a
broad grin on his good-humored face, holding in leash
Phil’s team. Every member of it, but big Amook
loudest of all, was vigorously demanding his three
meals of the day before and the one already due on
the present morning, or four in all.</p>

<p>On the Yukon it is customary to feed sledge-dogs
once in every twenty-four hours, and that at night,
after the day’s work is ended. In order that Musky
and Luvtuk and the others might be so unusually
hungry as to fully appreciate the first meal from
the hands of their new master, Kurilla had withheld
their meal of the previous evening, so that now they
were fairly ravenous. Near at hand stood Chitsah,
restraining with the utmost difficulty another team of
dogs that were destined to be driven by Serge. As
they had been regularly fed the evening before, they
could not have been so hungry as Phil’s team, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from their howlings one would think they had not
tasted food for a week.</p>

<p>Appreciating the seriousness of the situation, and
shouting to Serge to come out and attend to the wants
of his own team, Phil ran to the storehouse, from which
he took two dried salmon. They were so large that he
proposed to cut each into several pieces of such size as
seemed to him fitted to a dog’s throat. As he approached
his team he called to Serge to fetch him a
knife; but almost as he uttered the words he was given
to understand that it was not needed.</p>

<p>With a savage spring Amook reached his side, seized
one of the big fish in his powerful jaws, and with a
couple of convulsive gulpings swallowed it whole.
Having accomplished this feat he wagged his tail
cheerfully, and looked up into his young master’s face,
as much as to say, “That sample was so good that I
think I’ll take some fish, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you aren’t an ostrich!” Phil started to say;
but even as he opened his mouth to speak he was overthrown
and instantly buried beneath an avalanche of
dogs. Incited by Amook’s brilliant success, Musky,
Mint, Shag, and Luvtuk followed his example, while
the dogs held by Chitsah broke loose at the same moment,
and all projected themselves with the energy of
living catapults towards the single fish that Phil still
held.</p>

<p>Both Kurilla and Chitsah instantly flung themselves
on top of the confused mass of howling animals, and
for the space of a minute the scene enacted in full view
of the aroused inmates of the station was equal to any
first-class football scrimmage. Women screamed, while
men shouted and ran towards the place of battle.</p>

<p>In another minute the fierce animals had been torn
apart, flung this way and that, and were sneaking off
in so many different directions with lowered tails. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
two Indians were breathlessly but calmly readjusting
their disordered garments, the salmon had disappeared,
and Phil, sitting on the hard-packed snow, was tenderly
feeling of different parts of his body.</p>

<p>“Are you much hurt, old man?” cried Serge, anxiously,
as he reached his friend’s side.</p>

<p>“Serge,” replied Phil, solemnly, “did you ever
happen to see a good little book called the Franklin
Primer?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever did. Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it contains a picture that you would do
well to study. The picture is that of a small boy, with a
very anxious expression, hanging by his hands from the
outer end of a branch that projects over a tropical river.
Immediately beneath him swim a dozen open-mouthed
crocodiles regarding him with evident expectancy.
Beneath the picture is a legend to the effect that Johnny
is about to feed his pets. Now let’s turn in again
and finish out our nap.”</p>

<p>But there was too much to be done that day to admit
of further sleeping, and both lads quickly found
themselves full of business. To begin with, stores for
the expedition were to be selected and carefully packed.
Of these the largest single item was fish, to be used as
dog food, and with this one sledge was wholly laden.
Then came flour, tea, sugar, salt, bacon, hard bread,
evaporated fruit, a package of fine pemmican—which
is made of dried and pounded moose meat mixed with
berries and boiling fat in a rawhide bag, where it becomes
perfectly solid—oatmeal, a can of baking-powder,
molasses, a case of canned goods for special occasions,
a quantity of reindeer-back fat, to be used in
place of butter or lard, and a few pounds of tobacco
for trading with Indians.</p>

<p>For cooking utensils there was first and most important
of all the chynik, or copper tea-kettle, and an extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
one in case of accident. Then came a long-handled
fry-pan, a large iron pot, a brass kettle, a saucepan,
half a dozen tin plates, as many cups, spoons, and forks.
Besides these there was a wash-basin, and each man carried
a knife in a sheath attached to his belt.</p>

<p>At the head of the miscellaneous list came a fine
rifle for Phil’s especial use, and a double-barrelled shotgun,
with an ample supply of fixed ammunition for
both. Besides these Kurilla would carry his well-beloved
old flint-lock musket. Then came three axes,
one for each sledge, two hatchets, a case of awls, another
of needles, a supply of stout thread and sinew
for sewing, a thermometer, and a bolt of cotton cloth
to be used as wanted.</p>

<p>Most important of all for a winter journey in that
region of arctic cold was the outfit of fur clothing with
which each of the boys was liberally provided, and
some of which was made that very day by the nimble
fingers of Indian women. In each case this consisted
of a round, close-fitting fur cap of marten-skin; a
heavy caribou parka, or outer shirt, trimmed with wolverene
and wolf skin; an inner shirt of softest fawn-skin,
trousers of Siberian reindeer, boots of moose-shank
and seal, plenty of moccasins and fur-lined
arctic socks, and two pairs of mittens that reached to
the elbow. Of these the outer pair was of moose-hide
lined with heavy flannel, while the inner pair, the right
hand of which had a trigger finger as well as a thumb,
was made of lynx, with the fur inside.</p>

<p>A warm sleeping-bag for each boy was made by taking
a fine and extra heavy Mackinaw blanket, lining it
with marmot-skins, fur side out, covering the other side
with stout canvas as a protection against sparks and the
wet of melting snow, and sewing up the edges. This,
with a small pillow filled with geese feathers and a
large bear-skin, constituted an arctic bed in which one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
might sleep out-of-doors with comfort in the coldest of
weather.</p>

<p>These things, together with snow-shoes and native
snow-goggles, made of wood pierced with a long slit
and blackened on the inside, completed the outfit of
our young travellers. They were to use the ingalik,
or regular Yukon sledge, which is much lighter than
the Eskimo, or coast sledge, but heavier and stronger
than the Hudson Bay toboggan commonly used in the
interior.</p>

<p>The getting together of these things occupied all
hands for the greater part of the day, though after
satisfying himself as to his outfit of fur garments
Phil left the rest to Serge and Gerald Hamer, for he had
another very important duty to perform. This was arranging
<a href="#i_fp078">the exhibition drill</a> of his native soldier boys,
who had looked forward to it with such eagerness
that he could not bear to disappoint them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_78">THE EXHIBITION DRILL AT ANVIK</a></div>
</div>

<p>Fortunately the day was fine and not very cold, for
the school-room was so utterly inadequate to the accommodation
of both performers and spectators that
the drill was necessarily held outside.</p>

<p>Noon was the hour appointed for this most important
event, and by that hour the space reserved for spectators
was occupied by every inhabitant of the native
village. Their curiosity was raised to the highest
pitch of expectation, for the boys had kept their secret
so well that no one knew anything concerning the nature
of the exhibition.</p>

<p>For some minutes excitement was kept at fever
heat by strange sounds issuing from behind the closed
school-house doors, where the company was forming.
Then the door was flung open, and to the measured
beating of a drum that gruff Mr. Sims had made for
Little Sidorka, who was Big Sidorka’s brother, and at
that moment the proudest boy in Anvik, the dusky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
company marched forth in single file, headed by Big
Sidorka, who still wore the badge of honor that made
him the envied of all his fellows. Phil came last,
and at his command of “Company, <em>halt</em>! Right <em>face</em>!
Right <em>dress</em>! <em>’Tention!</em>” the long line stood straight
and motionless facing their awe-stricken relatives.</p>

<p>Then came in rapid succession the sharp, crisp orders
now so familiar to nearly every school-boy in the
United States, but never before heard by the public
of Anvik: “Present <em>arms</em>! Carry <em>arms</em>! Right shoulder
<em>arms</em>!” and the rest, until every movement of the
manual had been executed with a promptness and
precision that drew forth a storm of applause from the
delighted spectators. But when Phil handed his
wooden sword to Sergeant Sidorka, and the company
was put through the same drill without a mistake by
one of their own number, the enthusiasm of the onlookers
knew no bounds.</p>

<p>Then the company was put through the few simple
marching manœuvres that it had been able to practise
in the limited area of the school-room. Finally, when,
at the command “Charge <em>bayonets</em>! Double quick
<em>march</em>!” it advanced on the run with levelled guns
directly towards its admiring friends, they scurried
away in every direction with apprehensive screams as
though their brothers had become sure enough soldiers,
armed with real guns, and bent upon their destruction.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the exercises Phil promoted
Sergeant Sidorka to a captaincy, formally turned over
the command of the company to him, and hung about
his neck a medal beaten out of a silver dollar and engraved
with the single word “Captain.” To this day
if there is a prouder young fellow in all Alaska than
Big Sidorka, or a more exacting drill-master, it would
be hard to find him.</p>

<p>Serge bade his reading-class farewell that evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and commended them to the kindness of Mr. Sims,
the engineer, who to the surprise of every one had
volunteered to continue the work so successfully begun
by the young Russo-American.</p>

<p>That evening, too, Gerald Hamer gave Phil a list of
goods that the <i>Chimo</i> would take to the Forty Mile
Mining Camp in the spring, and the prices at which they
would be sold. He also gave him money enough to
defray the expenses of a trip to San Francisco, and a
long letter of instructions to the agent of the new trading
company in that city. This Phil was to supplement
by a verbal statement of the condition of affairs
in the Yukon diggings, and the class of goods most in
demand.</p>

<p>Thus was everything made ready for the morrow,
on which Phil and Serge were to set forth on a midwinter
search through the vast Alaskan wilderness for
the former’s dearly loved father, and begin the tremendous
journey which they hoped would carry them
to the very head-waters of the Yukon, and finally land
them in green Sitka town.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>MUSIC OF THE SLEDGE-BELLS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The cold winter morning that succeeded that memorable
day at the Anvik Mission witnessed an animated
scene in the open space between its stout log
buildings. Fur-clad figures hurried in all directions,
bringing last things and finishing the lading of the
three sledges that were to constitute the up-river brigade.
To each of these were attached seven dogs, it
having been decided at the last moment to add two
extra haulers to each team, as both dogs and fish for
their feed were much cheaper at Anvik than they would
be beyond that point. Then, too, with such strong
teams a high degree of speed could be maintained, for
while two of the sledges carried six hundred pounds
each, the third was laden with but half that weight, so
that if either of the boys became exhausted he could
ride, and so avoid the necessity of a halt.</p>

<p>Each dog’s harness was composed of three bands of
seal-skin, two of which passed over his back and were
toggled or buttoned under the belly, while the third,
which was extended into traces, crossed his chest.
The leader was attached to the end of a long pulling
thong of walrus hide, while the traces of the other
dogs, who ran in pairs, were knotted and made fast to
the same line at proper intervals. The two steer-dogs
were hitched directly to the hauling-bar in front of
the sledge.</p>

<p>The load of each sledge, enveloped in stout canvas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was immovably bound to it by a simple but ingenious
net-work of raw-hide lashing, so that the whole might
roll over and over without being loosened or disarranged.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock, or just as the laggard sun of those
short days was rising, the last hearty handshakes were
exchanged, the fervent “God bless yous” and final
farewells were uttered, and the start was made.</p>

<p>Kurilla, who was to act as runner and break a trail
through the snow, went first. Then came Phil’s team,
with the string of tiny bells attached to Musky’s harness
jingling merrily in the frosty air; after him followed
Serge, whose cheery good-nature and ready helpfulness
had won for him a warm place in every Anvik
heart; and the rear was brought up by Chitsah.</p>

<p>On the very brow of the steep descent to the river
Phil turned for a parting wave of his hand and a last
glance at the place that had grown to seem so much
like home in the past six weeks. His less sentimental
dogs sprang down the narrow track with such suddenness
that poor Phil, who still held to the sledge with
one hand, was jerked abruptly forward, threw the
sledge from the path in his effort to save himself, and
plunged with it down the bank. By thus taking a
header, Phil, his dogs, and his sledge reached the
bottom even in advance of Kurilla, sadly demoralized,
but except for a few bruises and a terrible snarl
of trace-lines none the worse for the accident.</p>

<p>When a few minutes later Serge reached the spot
with his anxious and now familiar inquiry, Phil cut
him short by saying,</p>

<p>“No, old man, I’m not hurt, though, of course, I
might have been. But I was willing to risk it for your
sake.”</p>

<p>“For my sake!” cried Serge, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, to set you an example in promptness of movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
You know I have always said we would never
get to Sitka unless we took advantage of every opportunity,
and pressed forward with all possible speed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” laughed Serge. “You remind me of
a story I heard in New London. An old Quaker was
driving along a country road with his boy sitting in
the back of the cart. Suddenly the horse shied, and
the boy was thrown out, whereupon the old man remarked,
quietly, ‘Be thankful for thy mercies, son, for
if thee’d fell in a particellar way thee’d broke thy
neck.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t,” replied Phil, “though I’m sure I
fell in a very particular way—at least, it was particularly
unexpected.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Kurilla’s deft fingers had repaired
all damages, and disentangled the apparently hopeless
snarl of dogs. Then the train was once more set in
motion, and, as it swept out on the broad surface of the
frozen river, was headed due north for the first stage
of its long journey. Fainter and fainter came the
music of its sledge-bells to those who watched its departure.
Its receding figures lessened until they were
but black specks against the illimitable expanse of
white, and finally vanished in the snow glint of its
wavering horizon.</p>

<p>To Phil Ryder, however, there was no vanishing
about the seven dogs that he was attempting to drive.
They were right before his eyes, where he was obliged
to keep them pretty constantly, too; for if he looked
away for an instant they knew it, and seized the opportunity
for mischief. There was not a lump of ice, a
hillock of snow, or a bit of drift that one or all of them
did not wish to smell of and investigate. If there was
an obstruction to be passed, three of them would try to
go on one side of it and four on the other. At sight of
a rabbit scurrying across the frozen field, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
give tongue and set forth in hot pursuit. Above all,
each of the five belonging to the original team was
spoiling for a fight with one or both of the new-comers,
to whom Phil had given the names of Lofter and
Brassy. If he glanced back to shout to Serge, Musky
would double on his tracks and spring at the throat of
the unoffending Lofter, who would abjectly roll on
his back with a howl of apprehension; Amook would
snap at his heels; Luvtuk would wheel upon Brassy;
and by the time Phil’s eye again rested on his team
they would be engaged in such a battle as would gladden
the heart of a city gamin. Then Kurilla would
rush back, seize Phil’s whip, and crack it about their
ears with such frightful reports that, in their frantic
efforts to escape, the offending dogs would only entangle
themselves still more hopelessly. In the meantime,
the other teams, thus forced to a halt, would sit on
their haunches, or lie in comfortable attitudes, and lift
their voices in sympathetic howls.</p>

<p>Finally, when this thing happened for about the tenth
time, Phil exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Look here, Kurilla, you and I must change places,
for I can’t stand this any longer. Besides, with the
present arrangement, we are spending more time disentangling
dogs than we are in travelling. I don’t
somehow seem to have learned the A B C of sledge
driving; but I am getting along pretty well with the
shoes, and believe I can walk ahead and tread out a
trail as well as any one.”</p>

<p>“All light,” answered the obliging fellow. “You
walk, me come. Me come fas’, you walk more fas’,
yaas.” Then, with a broad grin, he whirled Phil’s relinquished
badge of authority about his head in such
a manner as gave the dogs to understand that they
must now attend strictly to business or take the consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>So Phil assumed the leadership of the expedition, and
from that moment, though always willing to accept advice
from the others, he never dropped it.</p>

<p>When, shortly after three o’clock, the sun completed
its short course, and again reached the southern horizon,
he asked Kurilla if it were not about time to make
camp; but the Indian answered:</p>

<p>“No; go far as can make dog plenty tired. S’posin’
no git tired; night come, run to Anvik. Bad dog,
yaas. Git tired, night come, no run, sleep; good dog,
yaas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the scheme, is it?” laughed Phil. “Well,
I guess I can stand it as long as the rest can, though I
must confess I am about tired enough to rank with
the good dogs now.”</p>

<p>So in spite of lame ankles, and blistering heels, and
toes that were very tender from having been repeatedly
“stubbed” against the snow-shoe bars, the young
leader trudged sturdily forward, with the dog-teams
following close behind him. At length, when the dusk
was merging into darkness, Kurilla called out:</p>

<p>“Now camp. Plenty wood. Heap fire, yaas.”</p>

<p>They were passing a spruce-and-hemlock-covered
point, against which a pile of drift had lodged, and,
gladly accepting the Indian’s suggestion, Phil led the
way towards it. Twenty miles of the journey had
been accomplished, which, considering the late start
and that it was the first day, was pronounced to be
very good work.</p>

<p>For the next half-hour every one labored as though
his very life depended upon what he could accomplish
during those last precious moments of fading twilight.
Phil and Kurilla made their keen axes ring merrily in
an attack on the pile of dry drift-wood. Chitsah felled
a spruce-tree, from which he cut two logs, each six feet
long, and armful after armful of small branches. Serge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
erected a low but stout scaffold, on which the sledges
were to be placed to keep them out of the way of the
omnivorous dogs, who in the meantime were lying
down in their harness where they had been halted.</p>

<p>At the end of the half-hour a great back log twelve
feet long and a smaller fore log had been placed in
position, and enough dry wood collected to last until
morning. The direction of the wind was noted, and
the logs for the fire were so laid that it should blow
along their length, instead of across them from either
side. While Serge split kindlings and started his fire,
the two Indians unharnessed the patient dogs. The
harness, and especially the whips, were hung well beyond
their reach, for they will eagerly chew at the
former and invariably destroy the latter if by any
means they can get at them. Then the hungry animals
were fed, Serge leaving the fire to feed his own team,
and Phil rejoicing that he had escaped this dangerous
duty. Each dog was given a salmon weighing from
one pound and a half to two pounds, and each, as he
received his ration, gulped it down exactly as Amook
had done on a previous occasion. They followed their
meal with copious mouthfuls of snow that served instead
of water.</p>

<p>Serge, who naturally slipped into the position of
cook for the party, returned to the fire, which was now
blazing finely and sending a stream of sparks dancing
among the dark tree-tops. Phil busied himself with
the bed that he and Serge were to share, while Kurilla
and Chitsah would make theirs on the opposite side of
the fire. He rolled one of the green logs into position
close beside the fire for its foot-board, and then covered
a space some six feet square behind it with flat
spruce boughs, over which he spread a thick layer of
hemlock tips. Above all he laid the two great bear-skins,
and on them threw the two sleeping-bags, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of which had its owner’s name done in black paint on
its white canvas, and contained his personal belongings.</p>

<div class="caption">MAKING CAMP THE FIRST NIGHT OUT</div>
</div>

<p>Everything needed for the night being now taken
from the sledges, the Indians lifted them, with the remainder
of their loads, to the scaffold, on which were
also placed the snow-shoes. Then they made their own
bed—a very simple affair as compared with the one constructed
by Phil. With this the work of preparing
camp was finished, for in that far north land there is
no pitching of tents by winter <em>voyageurs</em>. These are
considered useless encumbrances in sledge travel, where
every pound of weight must be considered. They are
not needed as a protection against rain, for it is certain
that no rain will fall with the mercury below zero, and
they would be liable to catch fire from the roaring blaze
that is kept up all night.</p>

<p>So in the present case there was nothing more to be
done save wait as patiently as might be for supper—and
this Phil declared to be the hardest job he had tackled
that day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>WINTER TRAVEL BENEATH THE ARCTIC AURORA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With the advent of darkness and the dying out of
the wind there came such an increase of cold that from
all parts of the forest were heard sharp, crackling
sounds caused by the cruel pinchings of a bitter frost.
Phil had thrust his thermometer into the snow at the
head of his bed, and was surprised to find, on looking
at it, that it already registered fifteen degrees below
zero. He had been so warmed with violent exercise
that it had not seemed so very cold; but now he shivered
and drew closer to the fire.</p>

<p>For his cooking, Serge was first obliged to melt snow
in order to obtain water; but now the teakettle was
singing merrily, bacon and dried venison were sizzling
together in the capacious fry-pan; and on the opposite
side of the fire the two Indians were rapturously sniffing
the delicious odors that came from it. They were toasting
a fat salmon impaled on a slender stick, and at
the same time whetting their appetite by frequent bites
from a lump of pemmican that was handed from one
to the other.</p>

<p>Phil asked for a bit of this when Serge took it from
its bag, for, he said, “I have read of pemmican all my
life, and from the amount of praise bestowed on it by
the writers, think it must be pretty fine eating.” So
he tried it, took one mouthful, and flung the rest to
Musky, who had drawn close to him, and was watching
his experiment with undisguised interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whew-w!” sputtered Phil, ejecting the tasteless
morsel from his mouth. “If that’s pemmican, then
those who like it may keep it to themselves; but I
certainly don’t want any more of it. I suppose,
though, it is because my taste has not been cultivated
to appreciate it any more than it has raw seal’s liver
and similar dainties.”</p>

<p>Before supper both Phil and Serge afforded the Indians
considerable amusement by devoting a basin of the
precious water to a thorough cleansing of their faces
and hands. Kurilla and Chitsah not only considered
this a waste of time, water, and soap, but, as the former
remarked, with an expressive shake of his head:</p>

<p>“No good. More clean, more quick git dirty,
yaas.”</p>

<p>“Which sentiment,” said Phil, in a low tone, to
Serge, “explains why Indians and Eskimos and the
like generally sit on one side of the fire when white
men occupy the other.”</p>

<p>Throwing a handful of tea into the chynik, lifting it
from the fire the moment it again came to a boil, and
then setting it in a warm place to “draw,” Serge next
removed the cooked meat from the fry-pan to a heated
plate. Into the hot grease that remained he placed a
double handful of broken biscuit, previously soaked
for a few minutes in the brass kettle. When this had
absorbed every drop of grease and begun to brown, it
was ready to be eaten with molasses as a dessert.</p>

<p>“One of the very best dinners I ever ate in all my
life, old man!” declared Phil, after half an hour of uninterrupted
devotion to plate and cup. “I believe it is
fully equal to that gorgeous spread you had ready for
me on Oonimak after my experience with the sea-otter
hunters. As for the tea! Well, I never realized before
what a good thing tea is, and how much a fellow
can drink of it. Have I had six or twenty of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
big tin cups full? No matter, it’s either one or the
other, and every one of them has gone right to the
spot where it will do the most good. Wouldn’t my
Aunt Ruth be horrified, though, if she could see us
dispose of that amount of straight tea? She used to
consider one small cup, with plenty of milk in it,
about the proper thing for a boy’s daily allowance.
But then Aunt Ruth never enjoyed the advantage of
drinking her tea out-of-doors, with the mercury away
down below freezing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you mean below zero?” suggested Serge,
who was refilling the chynik with hot water, and setting
it on to boil, that what virtue still remained in the
tea-leaves might be extracted for the use of the Indians.</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” retorted Phil. “Why, it has grown
at least twenty degrees warmer during the past half-hour.”
So saying, he reached for the thermometer and
held it to the light, where, to his disgust, he saw that
it registered three degrees lower than when he last
looked, or eighteen degrees below zero.</p>

<p>“You prevaricating old tin villyan!” he cried. “You
are away off, and you know it. Oh, if I could only get
one cup of that tea inside of you! It would bring you
to your senses quick enough.”</p>

<p>The Indians had their own wooden bowls, or “kantags,”
horn spoons, and tin cups, and while they ate
their supper they were again amused by seeing Serge
wash all his dishes and cooking utensils with hot,
soapy water. They allowed their favorite dogs to lick
their kantags clean, and it must be admitted that the
operation was quickly and thoroughly performed.</p>

<p>After supper a line was rigged, and on it were hung
mittens, travelling-boots, and the pads of dry grass that
are worn inside of them as insoles. Serge set a big
kettle of deer meat, pemmican, and oatmeal on the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to simmer into a stew for breakfast and lunch the next
day. He also fixed a slab of snow where, as it melted,
it would drip into the teakettle. By his advice Phil
bathed his swollen ankles with water as hot as he could
bear it and rubbed tallow on the blistered places. This
treatment was to be followed by a dash of ice-water
and a brisk rubbing the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>On the other side of the fire the Indians indulged in
the long-pipe smoke that after a hard day’s work affords
the chief enjoyment of their monotonous lives.
When it was finished Kurilla went out for a final look
at the sledges and dogs, and threw a couple more logs
on the fire. Then he rolled up in his rabbit-skin robe
for as many hours of sleep as he could obtain before it
would be necessary to again replenish the fire and incidentally
to take another smoke.</p>

<p>Removing only their heavy outer parkas, with their
feet incased in soft arctic sleeping-socks, their heads
protected by close-fitting fur caps, and sheltered from
the cold by the triple thickness of their fur-lined sleeping-bags,
Phil and Serge lay on their bear-skins, feet to
the fire, and slept the untroubled sleep of tired and
healthy youth. About them clustered the solemn trees
of that Northern forest, just beyond lay the river frozen
into white silence, and above all glowed the exquisite
mysterious sky-tintings of an aurora, pervading all
space with its flashing brilliancy quivering with ceaseless
motion, though giving forth neither heat nor sound
and but little light. With the rising moon frost crystals
glistened in the air, and the long-drawn howl of a
wolf echoed mournfully through the forest. Every dog
in the camp promptly answered it, while Kurilla arose
with a shiver and mended the fire; but of all this the
two lads lying side by side on their rude couch knew
nothing.</p>

<p>It was Phil who first awoke and looked out from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
warm nest. With a shudder at the bitterness of the air
he would have withdrawn his head and snuggled down
for another nap, but for two thoughts that just then
flashed into his mind. One was of his father, whom he
believed to be encamped within one hundred miles or
so of him on that very river, and whom he was bound
to overtake. The second thought was that as leader of
the expedition it was his place to set the others an example.
It would be pleasant to lie there and sleep until
sunrise, but braver to set forth at once. In another
minute he had struggled from the sleeping-bag, pulled
on his heavy parka, and was shouting, cheerily:</p>

<p>“Come, wake up! wake up! Tumble out, all hands!
Don’t you see the sun a-shining, and hear the little
birds a-singing?”</p>

<p>“Looks more like the moon, and sounds like dogs,”
growled Serge, sleepily, as he sat up and rubbed his
eyes. “My! but it <em>is</em> cold!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Phil. “Fifty below at least, and
more, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p>It really seemed as cold as that, and when his thermometer
showed only twenty degrees below zero he declared
it to be a fraud, and unworthy of further consideration.
None but those who have experienced similar
conditions can imagine the misery of that camp-breaking
and getting under way. The hunting from their
snowy lairs and harnessing of unwilling dogs, the
lashing of loads and the tying of knots with numbed
fingers, the longing to hug the fire in one’s arms, and
the hundred other forms of torture incident to the relentless
cold, all combined to give Phil a rude foretaste
of what that journey was to be. Amid all the wretchedness
Serge was, as usual, the comforter, and with his
smoking stew and hot tea did much towards restoring
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>It wanted some hours to sunrise when the sledges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
pulled out from camp, regained the river, and resumed
their northward journey. The sky was overcast, and
an ominous moaning sounded through the forest.
Soon a breeze began to blow in angry gusts full in the
faces of our travellers, and by sunrise it was sweeping
furiously down the river, whirling the dry snow in
blinding clouds and driving the icy particles with
stinging force into face and eyes. Noses and cheeks
became white and numb, the deadly cold was driven
through fur and flannel until it penetrated the very
marrow. Even the dogs plodded on with lowered
heads and pitiful whimperings, while their masters
were obliged to turn their backs to the gale every few
minutes for breath and a momentary respite from the
fierce struggle.</p>

<p>“’Tis <em>poorga</em>—yaas!” shouted Kurilla.</p>

<p>“Aye, <em>poorga</em>!” answered Serge, and for the first
time Phil comprehended the full significance of the
terrible word which means the wind of death.</p>

<p>By noon human endurance could hold out no longer,
and, ready to drop with cold, pain, and exhaustion,
Phil led his train to camp in a belt of timber so thick
that even that fierce wind could not penetrate it,
though among the tree-tops it shrieked and howled
with demoniac fury.</p>

<p>Thus from camp to camp, through sunshine and
darkness, storm and calm, stinging cold and whirling
snows, the little party toiled onward, making twenty,
thirty, and as high as forty miles a day. They passed
the Indian settlement of Nulato, once a noted Russian
trading-post, at the end of ten days’ travel, and a week
later gained the mission station of old Fort Adams,
four hundred miles from their point of departure. At
several Indian villages they had heard of the party in
advance of them, whose camps they also sometimes
found. The trail was growing fresh, and at Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Adams they expected to gain definite information of
those whom they sought, if indeed they did not overtake
them at that point. At any rate, they would find
a missionary there from whom they would surely receive
news.</p>

<p>The first word obtained by Kurilla from the mission
Indians, who swarmed forth to greet them, was that
the missionary was absent, and that those whom they
sought had passed only the day before. The second
was that one of that party had returned but an hour
previous, and was even now in the missionary’s house.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp094">“You fadder, yaas,”</a> added Kurilla, reassuringly,
with a grin of delight, as he led Phil in that direction.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_94">“YOU FADDER, YAAS”</a></div>
</div>

<p>With a loudly beating heart the excited lad opened
the door. There sat a man—a white man—in an attitude
of the deepest dejection. He was long and lank.
His fur garments ill became him. Phil’s heart sank;
for in this uncouth figure there was no trace of his
own dear father. Then, as the woe-begone face was
slowly turned to meet his, he uttered a gasping shout
of amazed recognition.</p>

<p>“Jalap Coombs, by all that is wonderful!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>PHIL HEARS FROM HIS FATHER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Months before Phil and Serge had bidden farewell
to Jalap Coombs in an ancient barrabkie on Oonimak
Island. They believed they were only leaving him for
a short time, but on their return he had disappeared,
nor from that day to this had they learned anything
concerning him. Now, to have him reappear in this
mysterious manner in an Indian village hundreds of
miles up the Yukon River, apparently friendless and
alone, was so incredible that, after his first exclamation,
Phil stepped closer and took another look at the
weather-beaten face to establish its identity beyond a
doubt.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s me, son! It’s me, fast enough!” cried the
ex-mate of the <i>Seamew</i>, in a voice that trembled with
joyful emotion, as he sprang to his feet and grasped
Phil’s hand in his. At the same time a suspicious dimness
came into his eyes that he brushed away hastily.</p>

<p>“It’s the same old Jalap,” he continued, “and only
one minute ago he were about as forlorn <em>and</em> miserable
a sailor-man as ever were stranded a thousand miles from
salt water. Now, seeing that in sich a short space of
time he’s been h’isted from the hold of grief to the
main-r’yal mast-head of happiness by the sight of your
blessed phiz, ye mustn’t be surprised to find his rigging
at loose ends and decks ginerally cluttered up.
But the squall’s blown over, lad. You’ve brought fair
weather, and I’ll have the old packet ship-shape <em>and</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Bristol fashion again in a shake. What I sartainly
orter done was to remember my old friend Kite Roberson’s
advice consarning squalls, I’ve spoke to ye of
old Kite afore, hain’t I?”</p>

<p>“The name sounds familiar,” replied Phil. “But
how in the name of—”</p>

<p>“Waal, ef I didn’t I’d orter, for Kite were one of the
finest of men. Why, me and him—”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, now I remember,” assented Phil. “What
did he say about squalls?”</p>

<p>“That in all his experience he never see a squall so
heavy but what fair weather’d come after it sooner <em>or</em>
later. But Phil, my son, where hev you dropped from?
Where’s your shipmate? And where’s that bloomin’
shark of a cap’n what carried ye off right from under
your own father’s very eyes?”</p>

<p>“My father!” shouted Phil. “What do you know
about my father? Have you ever seen him? Where
is he? Has he gone on up the river?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Serge, entering at that moment and
greeting his old friend with extended hand; “that is
what we want to know first of all. Where is Mr.
Ryder? They told me he was in here with Phil, so I
waited outside until certain that the only other voice
was yours, and then I ventured in.”</p>

<p>“Of course ye did, and I’m prouder to see you than
ef ye were the King of all the Rooshias <em>and</em> Chiny to
boot. But consarning your father, Phil. Have I ever
seed him, say you? Waal, occasionally, considering as
me and him cruised together for nigh two months in
Bering Sea sarching for you boys. When we finally
come up with ye in Norton Sound and see that you
were steaming right ahead, paying no attention to signals,
it mighty nigh broke your father’s heart. It
stopped a bit short of that, though, and only broke his
leg instead, at which the swab as were steering run the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
schooner aground on a mud bank. Then by the time
I’d got Mr. Ryder below and come on deck again you
were hull down.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that my father actually broke one of
his legs?” queried Phil, who could not believe he had
heard aright.</p>

<p>“Sartain I do,” was the answer. “You see, we were
aboard an old tub named <i>Philomeel</i>, which we had
chartered her in Oonalaska for a cruise to Oonimak
to pick you up. Thar we fell in with a revenoo-cutter,
and she sent us up to the islands.”</p>

<p>“Not the <i>Phoca</i>?”</p>

<p>“The very same, with Miss May and Cap’n Matthews
in command. At the islands we heerd of ye
through an Injin chap who had piloted your ship.”</p>

<p>“Nikrik!” exclaimed Serge.</p>

<p>“Nikrik were his name,” assented Jalap Coombs.
“So we give chase, laid a course for St. Michaels, and
got there in time for Mr. Ryder to make you out
through his glass. Then he thought he had ye for
sure, though I give him one of old Kite Roberson’s
warnings. But he didn’t take no notice, and were
climbing the main rigging to make a signal for ye to
heave to, when a ratlin’ give way and dropped him on
deck. The man at the wheel jumped to save him, and
so did I, but it warn’t no use. He’d broke his leg,
and the old <i>Philomeel</i> took a sheer into the mud.”</p>

<p>“Poor father!” sighed Phil. “Now I know why
I’ve been worrying about him. I can’t understand,
though, how he could undertake such a terrible journey
with a broken leg.”</p>

<p>“Why not? They made him as comfortable as ef
he were in his own home. Besides, there warn’t nothing
else to be did.”</p>

<p>“Comfortable! with a broken leg, on a dog-sledge
trip of a thousand miles through an arctic wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in midwinter!” cried Phil. “Seems to me any one
who could find comfort under those conditions might
live in luxury on an iceberg in the Polar Sea.”</p>

<p>“Which it has been did,” replied the mate, gravely.
“But it begins to look as ef me and you was sailing
on different tacks. Where is it that you suppose your
father to be at this blessed minute?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere on the Yukon, not more than a day’s
journey from here, though when I entered this room
just now I fully expected to see him,” replied Phil,
who had so long cherished the hope of a speedy meeting
with his father that he could not even relinquish
the idea of his proximity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Serge, “that is what we were told,
and we have come nearly four hundred miles up the
river in search of him.”</p>

<p>It was now Jalap Coombs’s turn to stare in amazement.
At length he said: “So you’re spending the
winter up here hunting him, be ye, while he spent the
best part of the summer down there hunting you?
Seems to me it’s a leetle the most mixed-up hunting I
ever were consarned in. But it only goes to prove
what my old friend Kite Roberson useter offen say.
He useter say, Kite did, that the best way to find a
man is to set still in some likely place till he comes
by; but I never could hardly believe it till this minute.
Now I can see that ef Phil had set in Victoria
his father would have found him. Ef he’d set on the
<i>Seamew</i> he’d found his father in Sitka. Ef he’d set
on the cutter they’d met at Oonimak. Ef he’d set at
the islands he’d seen his father come that way afore
long, and the same at the Redoubt. Likewise ef Mr.
Ryder had set at St. Michaels in place of going to San
Francisco on the <i>Bear</i>, Phil would find him there when
he goes back from here. Yes, old Kite were a wiser
man than most, though you’d never believe it to see him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“You say that my father has gone to San Francisco.
Why did he do that?” queried the still bewildered
boy.</p>

<p>“To dock for repairs. You see, the <i>Bear</i> were the
last ship of the season to go out, and so she were his
only chance. She had a wracked crew aboard as were
willing to carry the <i>Philomeel</i> back to Oonalaska, and
that left me free to continue the search for you boys.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Phil, “of course it’s an awful disappointment
to find that I’m not to meet my father—at
least, not for some months to come—after all the trouble
I’ve taken to find him. At the same time I am glad to
know that he is safely out of this country for the winter,
even if it did take a broken leg to persuade him of the
foolishness of hunting for me. I should think he might
have found out long before that, though, how well able
Serge and I were to take care of ourselves. Poor dear
pop! How he must have suffered! I only hope he
will stay quietly in San Francisco until I can get to
him. Did he say how long he would wait there?”</p>

<p>“Only till sich time as he got his leg spliced and is
able to travel. Then he’s got to come back to Sitka
and settle up his business.”</p>

<p>“In that case things are working out all right, after
all,” said Phil, “for Sitka is the very place we are
bound for at this very minute.”</p>

<p>“But he warn’t going to stop there,” continued Jalap
Coombs, “only till the first spring ship left for St.
Michaels, when he reckoned to take passage on her and
come up after you.”</p>

<p>“But how did he expect to find us at St. Michaels
in the spring when he knew we left there in September?”</p>

<p>“Because the very cruise I’m shipped for is to find
you, pilot you back there, and moor alongside of ye till
he heaves in sight again. You see, he’s taken a notion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that he’d like to come up the river and have a look at
the diggings, which he don’t feel that he can till he has
you once more in tow. So, seeing as I were out of a
berth for the winter, and we heerd as you were froze
in somewheres up here on the river, I took the contract
to hunt ye and fetch ye back. I’ll allow, though, that
things was looking pretty dubious for me awhile ago,
and ef you hadn’t hove in sight as ye did I’d been all
at sea without compass or yet a chart. Now, though,
it’s all plain sailing again, and—”</p>

<p>“Is it?” interrupted Phil. “Seems to me this whole
affair is about as completely snarled as any I ever had
anything to do with, unless it was a fighting dog-team.
To begin with— But, I say, suppose we have supper
first and discuss the situation afterwards. I for one am
too hungry to think.”</p>

<p>“If you are any more hungry than I am you are hungry
enough to be dangerous,” laughed Serge; while
Jalap Coombs remarked that supper was the very thing
he was considering when Phil entered the room. “And
a mighty poor lookout it were,” he added, “for I hadn’t
any grub, nor didn’t know the best place to steal any,
nor yet warn’t quite hungry enough to steal a supper
anyway. So I were jest concluding to go without,
same as I did for dinner. But ef you boys has got anything
to eat—”</p>

<p>“Have we?” cried Phil; “you just wait and see.
Serge, did you know this was Christmas Day?”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed Serge, “for it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is so near to it, and this meeting is such a
joyous occasion, that I move we trot out our mince-pies,
and plum-puddings, and roast turkeys, and pemmican,
and things, and have a regular Christmas blowout.
That is, always supposing that Mr. Coombs will
loan us the use of his house. This is your house, is it
not, Mr. Coombs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sartain it is,” replied the mate, with a grin, and
entering fully into Phil’s absurdities. “Leastways,
there ain’t no one come to turn me out of it yet. So
you’re as welcome to it as I be. For, as old Kite Roberson
useter say—”</p>

<p>“Let’s have him for dessert,” laughed Phil, as he
started outside to discover what had become of the
sledges.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>THE MATE’S STORY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It is doubtful if there was a happier party in the
Yukon Valley, or even in all Alaska, than that which
unbidden, though none the less certain of their welcome,
took possession of the mission-house at old Fort
Adams that roaring December night. Certainly no
one could be happier than was Jalap Coombs at this
meeting with the boys in whose fortunes his had become
so strangely involved. At the time of their opportune
appearance he was in one of the most unhappy
and perplexing predicaments of his whole checkered
career; but now his troubles were blown away like a
morning mist, and already wellnigh forgotten.</p>

<p>When the schooner <i>Philomel</i>, finally released from
the bank on which she had grounded, reached St. Michaels,
Mr. Ryder was greatly distressed by the accounts
given him of the expedition on which Phil and
Serge had embarked. Knowing nothing of the conditions
under which they had been so glad to accept the
friendly offer of a roundabout passage to Sitka, and receiving
a cruelly false impression of Gerald Hamer’s
character as well as of his objects in ascending the Yukon,
he concluded that the boys had been trapped into
a reckless venture, which could only lead them to disaster
and suffering. In fancy he saw them imprisoned
by an arctic winter on a wretchedly constructed and
poorly equipped boat, as the <i>Chimo</i> was described to
him, or in some squalid Indian village, confronted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
freezing, starvation, and disease, remote from human
aid and without the means of escape.</p>

<p>Bitterly did he deplore the accident that prevented
him from organizing a relief party and going in person
to their rescue. When, on the day after his own arrival,
the revenue-cutter <i>Bear</i> touched at St. Michaels on
her way south and her commander offered him a passage
to San Francisco, where he could receive the surgical
attendance he so greatly needed, he at first refused,
declaring that nothing would induce him to leave the
country without his boy Phil.</p>

<p>Then it was that Jalap Coombs offered to remain in
his place, make an overland trip to the Yukon as soon
as winter travel should be practicable, find the boys,
and bring them back to St. Michaels, there to await
Mr. Ryder’s return in the spring.</p>

<p>“But you know nothing of the country nor of sledge
travel,” objected the latter. “You will not even know
on what portion of the river to look for the boys.
And, besides, what shall we do with the <i>Philomel</i>,
which has already cost me more than I can well afford?”</p>

<p>“It is true, sir, as you say, that I am ignorant of the
cruising-ground,” replied Jalap Coombs, “but I’d be
a poor sailor-man ef with chart and compass I couldn’t
make out to lay a course. Also, I’ve heerd of a party
as expects to start from here on a visit to all the up-river
trading-stations as soon as the season for sledge
navigation opens, and I reckon there wouldn’t be no difficulty
about me shipping with them as extry hand.</p>

<p>“As for driving dogs, my old friend Kite Roberson
useter say that a man can l’arn any trade ef he has to.
At the same time I’m considerable handy with both
belaying-pins and rope-ends, which, I take it, would be
jest as improving to the usefulness of dogs as to a crew
of swabs. When it comes to getting the bearings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
port in which the lads are laid by for the winter, that
would seem to be a case of the plainest kind of sailing.
They’re bound to be friz in afore long, even ef their
old kettle doesn’t break down and leave ’em stranded,
which it’s likely it will. Waal, then, I strikes across
country from here to the river, and says to the natyves
what lives on its banks: ‘Has sich and sich a steamer
gone up stream?’ says I; which ef they answers <em>si</em>, or
<em>oui</em>, or <em>ja</em>, or whatever stands for yes in their lingo, I
likewise goes on up. Ef they shakes their heads,
which is ‘No’ the world over, then I naturally goes
down, and keeps on down till I meets her.”</p>

<p>In spite of his present pain and mental distress Mr.
Ryder could not help smiling at the readiness with
which the simple-minded sailor thus disposed of difficulties
that to most people would appear insurmountable.
“But what shall we do with the <i>Philomel</i>?” he
asked, after a few moments’ consideration.</p>

<p>“Send her back to Oonalaska in charge of the
wracked whaling cap’n what has just come in on the
<i>Bear</i>. He’ll take her and be glad of the job, for I’ve
already sounded him.”</p>

<p>The more Mr. Ryder thought over the plan thus proposed
by the man who had already proved himself so
capable, so loyal, and so stanch a friend of the lost
boys, the more favorably he was inclined towards it,
and at length he decided to accept the mate’s proffered
services. So with many parting injunctions, and leaving
with him a sum of money sufficient to defray his
share of expenses in the proposed expedition, Phil’s
father sailed away on the <i>Bear</i> in search of the medical
aid that should enable him to return a few months
later, and undertake, in company with his boy, a long-cherished
scheme of exploration among the fabled gold-fields
of the interior.</p>

<p>Some six weeks later Jalap Coombs also set forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
from St. Michaels in company with two white men,
both of whom expressed an ardent admiration for Phil
Ryder, and great joy at the prospect of assisting in his
rescue from the wiles of the unprincipled trader who
had lured him away. Under their direction the confiding
sailor invested the entire sum left him by Mr.
Ryder in dogs, sledges, and provisions. He was amazed
at the exorbitant prices charged him for these things,
and was still more so to discover, when a few days out
from the fort, that with all his outlay he was credited
with but one team and a single sledge-load of provisions,
which he soon found himself exchanging for fish
with which to feed his dogs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as he had been unable to master the
art of dog-driving, his obliging friends had engaged
for him an Indian, who began to demand his wages at
the end of the first week, refused to work unless he
was paid in advance, and persisted in his demands with
such insolence that the mate finally felt himself obliged
to administer what he called a dose of belaying-pins
and rope-ends. The effect of this was a future obedience
to orders, accompanied by a sullen hatred,
which Jalap’s white companions seemed to take a malicious
delight in encouraging.</p>

<p>This sledge party went north along the coast from
St. Michaels to the mouth of the Unalaklik River,
and followed up that stream for several days. Then,
crossing a divide, they struck the Yukon at a point
near Nulato. Here they were told that a steamer,
supposed to be the <i>Chimo</i>, had passed on her way
up the river several days before the close of navigation.</p>

<p>By this time the relations between poor Jalap and
his companions had become so very unpleasant that he
had hoped for an excuse to leave them, and go down
the river from Nulato. As it was, he now felt obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to continue in their company until the <i>Chimo</i> should
be overtaken.</p>

<p>At old Fort Adams, after conferring with the natives,
his fellow-travellers informed him that the steamer
was frozen in about one day’s march above that place,
and with a lighter heart than he had known since beginning
the weary journey, he again set forth with
them, filled with eager anticipations. When just at
dusk of that same day they discovered a steamer snugly
moored to the bank, he read her name with a sinking
heart, for, instead of <i>Chimo</i>, it was <i>St. Michaels</i>, which
he knew to be the name of a boat belonging to a Catholic
mission on the lower river. Moreover, she was
boarded up and deserted.</p>

<p>As Jalap’s companions noted his expression of dismay,
they uttered shouts of mocking laughter, and
asked what else he had expected when the Fort Adams
Indians had mentioned that very name so plainly that
a deaf man ought to have understood it.</p>

<p>In camp that night the sailor announced his intention
of starting back down the river at daybreak, at
which the others only exchanged significant glances,
but said nothing. In the morning, after the sledges
were loaded and the dogs harnessed, it was discovered
that the driver of his sledge was missing. Telling him
that he was thus rightly served for chastising the poor
man, the others cracked their whips and started off up
the river, leaving poor Jalap standing on its bank helpless
and alone. <a href="#i_fp106">A few moments later</a>, at the sound of
a familiar whistle from the direction they had taken,
<a href="#i_fp106">his dogs started after their vanished companions</a>, carrying
with them his entire outfit.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_106">A FEW MOMENTS LATER HIS DOGS STARTED AFTER THEIR VANISHED COMPANIONS</a></div>
</div>

<p>With feet so badly used up from weeks of unaccustomed
snow-shoeing that every step was torture, the
deserted man at once realized the folly of pursuit, and
with a heavy heart began to retrace his slow way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
old Fort Adams. Reaching the mission completely
exhausted, and unable to proceed farther, he had taken
possession of the missionary’s house. Here, suffering,
penniless, friendless, and almost hopeless, he was trying
to form some plan for the future, when the door opened,
and, as he afterwards quaintly said, “Ef the good little
cherub what sets up aloft watching over poor Jack at
sea had flowed in at that minute, I couldn’t been better
pleased than I were to sight the blessed phiz of that
precious young rascal, Phil Ryder.”</p>

<p>Such was the tale related by Jalap Coombs to Phil
and Serge after the three had finished a dinner that included
every luxury in the outfit of our young travellers,
and between long, grateful pulls at “old comfort,”
his pipe, which they had also provided with
tobacco.</p>

<p>When the story was ended, Phil indignantly demanded
to know the names of the two white men who
claimed acquaintance with him and at the same time
dared treat his old friend so shamefully.</p>

<p>“Simon Goldollar were the name of one.”</p>

<p>“I might have known it—the sneak!” broke in
Phil.</p>

<p>“And the other are called Strengel.”</p>

<p>“The very scoundrel that I set ashore from the
<i>Chimo</i> for trying to blow her up!” cried Phil. “You
remember, Serge?”</p>

<p>“I should rather say I did!” replied the young Russo-American,
his honest face flushing with anger.</p>

<p>“But what are they going up the river for, Mr.
Coombs?”</p>

<p>“To spile Cap’n Hamer’s chance of doing any trading
at Forty Mile, as fur as I could make out,” replied
the mate.</p>

<p>“Oh, the villains!” exclaimed Phil. “And they have
got two days’ start of us, too, while you are almost unfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
for travel. Hold on, though! I have it! We can
do the trick yet, and give them a lesson in minding
their own business. Hurrah for our side, after all!
Serge, hurrah! quick, before I fling something at you.”</p>

<small>JALAP COOMBS’S FOURTEEN PAIR OF FEET</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Of course, Mr. Coombs, you can’t expect us to go
back to St. Michaels now,” began Phil, as a preliminary
to unfolding his scheme for the discomfiture of
Simon Goldollar and his unprincipled companion.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded the sailor, who had not for
a moment expected anything else. “As soon as I found
ye I were to bring ye to St. Michaels, and keep ye
there till your father comes. Them’s orders, and to
disobey ’em would be mutiny, nigh as I kin make out.”</p>

<p>“That would be all right if you had found us; but
you haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” queried Jalap Coombs. “I hain’t found ye?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” laughed Phil. “Instead of you
finding us, we have found you. If you had struck us
at Anvik, it is possible that we might have gone back
with you, but as we have found you some four hundred
miles from there, we shall certainly do nothing
of the kind. You see, to begin with, we are under the
greatest of obligations to Captain Hamer, who, by-the-way,
is one of the finest men I ever met.”</p>

<p>Here Phil told of the terrible experience he and
Serge had undergone in Bering Sea, and of their gallant
rescue by Gerald Hamer, all of which the absorbed
listener now heard for the first time.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued the lad, “we have left him just
recovering from a dangerous illness, and unfitted to
travel for some months. If he can’t get word out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the coast before spring he will be a heavy loser. So
Serge and I have undertaken to carry and deliver the
message for him. Our entire outfit, down to the very
clothing we wear, was furnished by him on that condition.
It is also our duty to try and defeat the plans
of his enemies, who are also our enemies, and now
seem to have become yours as well. So you see we
are in honor bound to push on with all speed. Besides
all this, we certainly ought to be able to reach
Sitka long before my father can get away from there,
and so save him a long, tedious, and useless journey.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sartain of that,” demurred Jalap Coombs.
“For ye’ve been trying to make Sitka long’s ever I’ve
knowed ye, which is going on a year now, and hain’t
come anywhere nigh to it yet. Still, as my old friend
Kite Roberson useter say, ‘Jalap, my son, allers steer
by sarcumstances; for as a gineral thing they’ll p’int
straighter’n a compass,’ and I am free to admit that
your present sarcumstances is p’inting pretty direct
towards Sitka. But how do ye propose to sarcumvent
the villyans what run off with my dogs?”</p>

<p>“Now you are talking straight business,” laughed
Phil. “As I understand it, the main object of those
fellows is to capture the next season’s trade of the Yukon
Valley, and especially of the diggings at Forty
Mile, by taking advance orders at lower rates than the
old company has ever before offered. Even then their
prices are certain to be exorbitant, and with Gerald
Hamer’s list I am certain I can underbid them. But
that won’t be of any use unless we can be first in the
field, for after the orders are given and contracts signed
those other chaps could laugh at us and our prices. So
our only hope is to reach Forty Mile ahead of them.”</p>

<p>“Which ye can’t do it without wings or steam,”
objected Jalap Coombs, “seeing as they has got two
good days’ start on ye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care if they had six days’ start,” answered
Phil. “I am confident that we could still beat
them with just ordinary snow-shoes and sledges and
plain every-day North American dogs. They have
gone around the great arctic bend of the Yukon, haven’t
they? And so have a journey of at least seven hundred
miles ahead of them before they reach Forty Mile.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jalap. “They said as it were the
only navigable channel.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t, for I know of another that is equally
good, and two hundred miles or so shorter. You see,
there is a big river coming from the southeast and
emptying into the Yukon somewhere in this vicinity,
called the Tanana.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented the sailor, “for I’ve already
passed its mouth twice about half-way between here
and where the <i>St. Michaels</i> is friz in.”</p>

<p>“Good enough,” said Phil. “Now by following
this Tanana for two or three hundred miles, and taking
up one of its eastern branches that is called the
Gheesah, or some such name, and crossing a divide,
we can strike the headwaters of Forty Mile Creek.”</p>

<p>“And sail down with the current, run into port under
a full press of canvas, and capture the market
afore the enemy heaves in sight!” exclaimed Jalap
Coombs, enthusiastically, his practical mind quick to
note the advantages of Phil’s scheme. “But what’s
to become of me?” he added, anxiously. “Kin ye fit
me out with a new pair of feet?”</p>

<p>“Certainly we can,” replied Phil, promptly. “We
can fit you out with fourteen new pair, and will guarantee
that, thus provided, you will be able to travel
as fast as the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“Fourteen pair o’ feet?” repeated Jalap Coombs,
reflectively, “and slow-shoes on every pair? Seems
to me, son, you must be calkilating to run me under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
kind of a santipede rig, which it looks like the strain
on the hull would be too great. As for navigating
fourteen pair of slow-shoes all to once, I don’t reckin
old Kite hisself could do it. Still, if you think it can
be did, why go ahead and try it on. I’m agreeable,
as the cat said after he’d swallowed the cap’n’s wife’s
canary.”</p>

<p>So Phil’s plan was adopted without a dissenting
voice, and from that moment Jalap Coombs said nothing
more about a return to St. Michaels.</p>

<p>That very evening, leaving Serge to see what could
be done for the sailor-man’s lameness, and taking Kurilla
with him to act as interpreter, Phil visited several
Indian huts. At these he finally succeeded in purchasing
enough furs and moose-hide for a huge sleeping-bag,
which the several squaws, who, under promise of
a liberal recompense in tea, undertook its construction,
promised should be ready by morning. Phil also
bought an immense pair of arctic sleeping-socks and an
extra supply of snow-goggles.</p>

<p>When he told Kurilla of their change of plan, and
that they intended going up the Tanana, the latter
replied, dubiously, “Me plenty don’t know um. Maybe
git lose. Yaas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be all right,” answered Phil, cheerfully.
“You’ll plenty know um before we get through with
um, and whenever you don’t know which way to go,
just come and ask me.”</p>

<p>When he returned to the house he found Serge boiling
with indignation. “Do you know,” he cried, “that
Mr. Coombs has walked all the way from St. Michaels
without pads in his boots, because those other fellows
told him his feet would toughen quicker if he didn’t
use them? The consequence is they are simply raw
from blisters, and every step he takes must be like
treading on knives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“It has been tedious at times,” admitted Jalap
Coombs. “And under the sarcumstances I don’t know
but what I’d ruther have one pair of feet than fourteen,
or even half the number.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it good to have old Jalap with us once more?”
asked Phil of Serge, after they had turned in that night.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is; but do you notice how he has
changed?”</p>

<p>“I should say I had. He is like a salt-water fish
suddenly dropped into a fresh-water pond. He’ll
come out all right, though, especially if we can only
get his feet into shape again.”</p>

<p>That night the mercury fell to fifty-nine degrees
below zero, and the next morning even Phil, impatient
as he was to proceed, had not the heart to order
men and dogs out into that bitter air before sunrise.
With that, however, the mercury began slowly to rise,
and when it had crept up nineteen degrees, or to only
forty degrees below, the young leader declared the
weather to be warm enough for anybody. So he ordered
the sledges to be got ready, and when the one
drawn by his own team came dashing up to the door,
he announced that Mr. Coombs’s fourteen pair of feet
were at his service. He also politely requested the
sailor-man to crawl into a big fur-lined bag with
which the sledge was provided, and make himself
comfortable.</p>

<p>“But, Phil,” demurred the other, “I ain’t no passenger
to be tucked up in a steamer-cheer on deck. I’m
shipped for this v’y’ge as one of the crew.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Phil. “Then of course you will
obey orders without a murmur, for I remember hearing
you say, when we were aboard the <i>Seamew</i>, that
even if a captain were to order his whole crew to knit
bedquilts or tidies, they’d be bound to obey to the best
of their ability.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sartain,” admitted the other. “I got that from
old Kite Roberson, which bedquilts <em>and</em> tidies were
his very words.” Then, without further remonstrance,
the crippled sailor stepped to the sledge, slid feet first
into the big bag, and lay there like an animated mummy,
with the hood of his parka drawn close about his
face. Its encircling fringe of long wolf-hair, added
to his preternatural gravity of countenance, gave him
such a comical expression that the boys could not help
shouting with laughter as Kurilla cracked his great
whip and the dogs sprang away with their new burden.</p>

<p>Phil took the lead, as usual, and when they reached
the mouth of the Tanana, which, on account of its
broad expanse, there was no chance of mistaking, he
turned into it without hesitation, and in a few minutes
they had taken their last view of the Yukon for
many a long day.</p>

<p>At its mouth the Tanana is nearly three miles
broad, or as wide as the Yukon itself, and is filled
with islands, on which are stranded quantities of uprooted
trees of greater size than any seen on the Yukon
above that point.</p>

<p>The bitterness of the cold continued unabated, and
the sledge party had hardly lost sight of the Yukon
ere the young leader heard himself hailed from the
rear, and paused to learn what was wanted.</p>

<p>“I say, Cap’n Phil,” began Jalap Coombs, with chattering
teeth, “is it your orders or desire that your men
should freeze to death?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” laughed the lad.</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I has the honor to report that this member
of the crew is already froze solid half-way up, with
ice making fast through the remainder of his system.”</p>

<p>“That is entirely contrary to orders,” replied Phil,
sternly, “and must be stopped at once. So, sir, put
your helm to port, and run for yonder timber.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Half an hour later poor Jalap was being outwardly
thawed by a roaring fire of great logs, and inwardly
by cupful after cupful of scalding tea, which moved
him to remark that, according to his friend Kite Roberson,
tea and coffee were the next best things to observations
of the sun for determining latitude.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>CHRISTMAS ON THE TANANA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Look here,” said Phil, referring to the mate’s last
surprising statement, “wasn’t your friend Mr. Roberson
in the habit of drawing the long bow?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Jalap Coombs, in surprise at the
question; “he couldn’t abide ’em.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t abide what?”</p>

<p>“Bows, nor yet arrers, since when he were a kid
some boys put up a game on him that they called
William Tell, which allers did seem to me the foolishest
game, seeing that his name warn’t William, but
Kite, and he warn’t expected to tell anything, only
just to stand with a punkin on his head for them to
shoot their bow-arrers at. Waal, the very fust one
missed the punkin and plunked poor Kite in the
stummick, after which he didn’t have no use for a
long bow nor a short bow, nor yet a bow of any kind.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame him,” laughed Serge. “But we
would very much like to know how he determined
latitude by tea and coffee.”</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” was the reply. “You see, tea is
drunk mostly in cold latitoods similar to this, and coffee
in warm. The higher the latitood, the hotter and
stronger the tea, and the less you hear of coffee. At
forty-five or thereabouts they’s drunk about alike,
while south of that coffee grows blacker and more
common, while tea takes a back seat till you get to
the line, where it’s mighty little used. Then as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
go south of that the same thing begins all over again;
but there’s not many would notice sich things, and
fewer as would put ’em to practical use like old Kite
done.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Coombs,” said Phil, “you sound pretty well
thawed out, and if that is the case we’ll get under way
again.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” responded the mate, thrashing his
long arms vigorously across his chest to restore circulation,
and then slipping resignedly into his fur bag.
“Anchor’s apeak, sir.” And away sped the sledges
up the broad level of the Tanana.</p>

<p>Every member of the party had by this time become
so thoroughly broken in to his duties that when
they made camp that night the promptness with which
it was prepared, as well as the ensuing comfort, was a
revelation to Jalap Coombs, who declared that there
had been nothing like it in the camps of the other
party.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Phil, “for they haven’t got
Serge Belcofsky along, so how could their comfort
equal ours?”</p>

<p>At this Serge, covered with confusion, replied, “Nonsense,
Phil! You know it is because we have got such
capital campmen as Kurilla and Chitsah with us.”</p>

<p>At this the face of the elder Indian beamed with
pleasure. He did not exactly understand the conversation;
but believing that he ought to make some reply,
he pointed to Jalap Coombs, and, looking at Phil,
remarked:</p>

<p>“You fadder. Yaas.”</p>

<p>But the journey up the Tanana was by no means
an unbroken record of swift movings from one comfortable
camp to another, or of jokes and pleasantries.
The days were now at their shortest, so that each could
boast only about four hours of sunlight, and even that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was frequently obscured by fierce storms, when the
howling winds cut like knives, and it required every
ounce of Phil Ryder’s pluck as well as Serge Belcofsky’s
dogged determination to keep the little party in
motion. The feet of the poor dogs were often so
pierced by ice slivers that their tracks were marked
with blood. The older and more experienced would
bite at these and pull them out. Others would howl
with pain, while some would lie down and refuse to
work until they were put in boots, which were little
bags of deer-hide drawn over their feet and fastened
with buckskin thongs.</p>

<p>It was a journey of constant and painful struggle
and of dreary monotony, each day being only the same
endless succession of ice-bound river, snow-covered
hills, and sombre forest. Especially depressing was
the night of the 24th of December, when, with an icy
wind moaning through the tree-tops of the subarctic
forest, and the shivering dogs edging towards the fire
for a share of its grateful warmth, Phil and Serge and
Jalap Coombs reminded each other that this was Christmas
Eve. Never before had Phil spent one away from
home, nor had the others ever been so utterly removed
from the cheering influences of the joyous season. So
Phil described what he knew was taking place in far-distant
New London at that very hour, and Serge told
of merry times in quaint old Sitka, while Jalap Coombs
recalled many a noble plum-duff that had graced Christmas
feasts far out at sea, until they all grew homesick,
and finally crawled into their sleeping-bags to dream
of scenes as remote from those surrounding them as
could well be imagined.</p>

<p>As they always selected a camping-place and prepared
for the long night by the last of the scanty daylight
or in the middle of the afternoon, so they always
resumed their journey by the moonlight or starlight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
or even in the darkness of two or three o’clock the
next morning. On Christmas morning they started, as
usual, many hours before daylight, and, either owing
to the vagueness of all outlines, or because his thoughts
were far away, the young leader mistook a branch for
the main river, and headed for a portion of the mighty
wilderness that no white man had ever yet explored.</p>

<p>About noon they passed a forlorn native village of
three or four snow-covered huts, the occupants of
which gazed at the unaccustomed sight of white travellers
in stolid amazement. They had gone nearly a
mile beyond this sole evidence of human occupation
to be found in many a weary league when Phil suddenly
stopped.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he exclaimed, “what do you two say
to going back, making a camp near that village, and
having some sort of a Christmas, after all? It doesn’t
seem right for white folks to let the day go by without
celebrating it somehow.”</p>

<p>As the others promptly agreed to this proposition
the sledges were faced about, and a few minutes later
the music of Musky’s jingling bells again attracted the
wondering natives from their burrows.</p>

<p>Camp was made on a wooded island opposite the
village, and while the others were clearing the snow
from a space some fifty feet square, and banking it up
on the windward side, Phil took his gun and set forth
to hunt for a Christmas dinner. An hour later he returned
with four arctic hares and a brace of ptarmigan,
or Yukon grouse, whose winter plumage was as spotless
as the snow itself.</p>

<p>He found Serge and Jalap Coombs concocting a
huge plum-duff, while from the brass kettle a savory
steam was already issuing. Kurilla and Chitsah had
chopped a hole through four feet of ice and were fishing,
while a few natives from the village hovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
about the outskirts of the camp, watching its strange
life with curious interest. They were very shy, and
moved away when Phil approached them, seeing which
he called Kurilla and bade him tell them that a present
would be given to every man, woman, and child who
should visit the camp before sunset.</p>

<p>At first they could not comprehend this startling
proposition, but after it had been repeated a few times
the youngest of them, a mere boy, uttered a joyous
shout and started on a run for the village. A few
minutes later its entire population, not more than
twenty-five in all, including babes in arms, or rather in
the hoods of their mother’s parkas, came hurrying over
from the mainland filled with eager expectancy.</p>

<p>To every man Phil presented a small piece of tobacco,
to every woman a handful of tea, and to every
child a biscuit dipped in molasses. With each present
he uttered, very distinctly, the word “Christmas.” At
length one child—though whether it were a boy or a girl
he could not make out, for their fur garments were all
exactly alike—looked up with a bashful smile and said
<a href="#i_fp120">“Kikmuk.”</a> In a minute all the others had caught the
word, and the air rang with shouts of “Kikmuk,” mingled
with joyous laughter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 534px;">
<a id="i_fp120">
  <img src="images/i_fp120.jpg" width="534" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_120">“KIKMUK”</a></div>
</div>

<p>Then they all trooped back to the village, shouting
“Kikmuk” as they went; and so long as they live the
word will be associated in their minds with happiness
and good-will. Three of them, a man and two women,
afterwards returned, bringing with them a pair of dainty
moccasins, a fox-skin, and an intestine filled with melted
fat, which they timidly presented to Phil, Serge, and
Jalap Coombs respectively. The last named regarded
his gift rather dubiously, but accepted it with a hearty
“Kikmuk,” and remarked that it would probably be
good for his feet, which it afterwards proved to be.</p>

<p>These three were invited to dine with Kurilla and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Chitsah, an invitation which they accepted, and so became
the guests of the Christmas dinner. On their
side of the fire the feast consisted largely of the fish
the Indians had just caught, to which were added unstinted
tea and a liberal supply of the plum-duff. On
the other side were mock-turtle soup <em>à la can</em>, baked
fish, rabbit fricassee, roast grouse, plum-duff, hard
bread, tea, and cocoa; all of which combined to form
what Phil pronounced to be the very best Christmas
dinner he had ever eaten, in which sentiment Serge and
Jalap Coombs heartily concurred.</p>

<p>Even the dogs were given cause to rejoice that
Christmas had at length come to their snowy land by
receiving a double ration of dried fish, which put them
into such good spirits that they spent the greater part
of the night in a rollicking game of romps.</p>

<p>On the Indian side of the fire the unwonted good
cheer so overcame the shyness of the villagers that
the man ventured to ask questions regarding the intentions
and destination of this sledge party of strangers.
When these were stated by Kurilla, he remained
silent for a minute. Then he delivered a long and animated
speech.</p>

<p>As a result of this, and when it was finished, Kurilla
left his own side of the fire and, approaching Phil,
said:</p>

<p>“You go Forty Mile?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We are going to Forty Mile, of course.”</p>

<p>“No like um Tanana?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, I like the Tanana well enough. I shall
like it better, though, when we have seen the last of
it.”</p>

<p>“No can see um now.”</p>

<p>“Why not? There it is right out yonder.”</p>

<p>“No. Him Kloot-la-ku-ka. Tanana so” (pointing
to the way they had come). “You go so way” (pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
up-stream), “get lose; mebbe no fin’; plenty bad.
Yaas!”</p>

<p>So, all on account of keeping Christmas and trying
to bring a little of its joy into the hearts of those children
of the wilderness, Phil’s mistake was discovered
before its consequences became disastrous, and he was
once more enabled to place his little party on the right
road to Sitka.</p>

<small>A BATTLE WITH WOLVES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The remainder of the journey up the Tanana was
uneventful, but so long that the new year was well
begun ere the sledge party left it and turned up the
Gheesah branch, which flows in from the east. An
Indian guide, procured at the last village by the promise
of a pound of tobacco for his services, accompanied
them on their four days’ journey up this river, and
to the summit of the bleak, wind-swept divide, five
hundred feet above timber-line. This gave the dogs
a hard pull, though Jalap Coombs insisted upon lightening
their load by walking; nor from this time on
would he again consent to be treated as an invalid.</p>

<p>The summit once passed, they plunged rapidly down
its farther side, and into the welcome shelter of timber
fringing a tiny stream whose course they were now to
follow. Their guide called it the Tukh-loo-ga-ne-lukh-nough,
which, after vain attempts to remember, Phil
shortened to “Tough Enough.” Jalap Coombs, however,
declared that this was not a “sarcumstance” to
the names of certain down-East streams among which
he was born, and to prove his assertion began to talk
glibly of the Misquabenish, the Keejimkoopic, the
Kashagawigamog, the Kahwahcambejewagamog, and
others of like brevity, until Phil begged him to take a
rest.</p>

<p>That night, while the camp was buried in the profound
slumber that followed a day of unusually hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
work, and the fire had burned to a bed of coals, the
single, long-drawn howl of a wolf was borne to it with
startling distinctness by the night wind. As though
it were a signal, it was answered from a dozen different
directions at once. The alert dogs sprang from
their snowy beds with bristling crests, and hurled back
a challenge of fierce barkings; but this, being an incident
of nightly occurrence, failed to arouse the tired
sleepers.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the dread howlings had so increased
in volume that they seemed to issue from scores
of savage throats, and to completely encircle the little
camp. It was as if all the wolves of the forest, rendered
desperate by famine, had combined for a raid
on the supply of provisions so kindly placed within
their reach. Nearer and nearer they came, until their
dark forms could be seen like shadows of evil omen
flitting among the trees and across the open moonlit
spaces.</p>

<p>The dogs, at first eager to meet their mortal foes,
now huddled together, terrified by overwhelming numbers.
Still the occupants of the camp slept, unconscious
of their danger. Suddenly there came a rush,
an unearthly clamor of savage outcry, and the sleepers
were roused to a fearful wakening by a confused struggle
within the very limits of the camp, and over their
recumbent forms. They sprang up with yells of terror,
and at the sound of human voices the invaders drew
back, snapping and snarling with rage.</p>

<p>“Timber wolves!” shouted Serge. “Your rifle,
Phil! Quick!”</p>

<p>Emboldened by this reinforcement, the dogs advanced
to the edge of the camp space, but with low
growls in place of their former defiant barkings.</p>

<p>Phil was trembling with excitement; but Serge,
steady as a rock, was throwing the No. 4’s from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
double-barrel and reloading with buckshot, at the
same time calling to Chitsah to pile wood on the
fire, and to the other Indians not to fire until all were
ready. Jalap Coombs seized an axe, and, forgetful of
the bitter cold, was rolling up his sleeves as though he
purposed to fight the wolves single-handed. At the
same time he denounced them as pirates and bloody
land-sharks, and dared them to come within his reach.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” cried Serge; “then fire!” And
with a roar that woke the forest echoes for miles, the
four guns poured their contents into the dense black
mass that seemed just ready to hurl itself for a second
time upon the camp.</p>

<p>With frightful howlings the pack scattered, and
began to gallop swiftly in a wide circle about the fire-lit
space. One huge brute, frenzied with rage, leaped
directly towards the camp, with gleaming eyes and
frothing mouth. Ere a gun could be levelled, Jalap
Coombs stepped forward to meet him, and, with a
mighty, swinging blow, his heavy axe crushed the skull
of the on-coming beast as though it had been an eggshell.
Instantly the dogs were upon him, and tearing
fiercely at their fallen enemy.</p>

<p>With the first shot Phil’s nervousness vanished, and
as coolly as Serge himself he followed, with levelled
rifle, the movements of the yelling pack in their swift
circling. At each patch of moonlit space one or more
of the fierce brutes fell before his unerring fire, until
every shot of his magazine was exhausted.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp126">“Now,” cried Serge</a>, “we must scatter them. Every
man take a firebrand in each hand, and <a href="#i_fp126">all make a
dash together.”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_125">“NOW,” CRIED SERGE, “ALL MAKE A DASH TOGETHER!”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Yelling,” added Jalap Coombs.</p>

<p>“Yes, yelling louder than the wolves themselves.”</p>

<p>The plan was no sooner proposed than adopted.
Musky, Luvtuk, big Amook, and the rest, inspired by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
their masters’ courage, joined in the assault; and before
that fire-bearing, yelling, on-rushing line of humanity
and dogs the gaunt forest raiders gave way and
fled in all directions.</p>

<p>The whole battle had not lasted more than five minutes,
but it resulted in the death of nineteen wolves,
six of which were despatched by the sailor man’s terrible
axe after the fight was over and they, more or
less wounded, were slinking away towards places of
hiding. But the dogs found them out, and they met a
swift fate at the hands of Jalap Coombs.</p>

<p>As he finally re-entered the camp, dragging the last
one behind him, he remarked, with a chuckle,</p>

<p>“Waal, boys, I ruther guess our boat’s ‘high line’
this time, and I’m free to admit that this here wolf
racket beats most kinds of fishing for genuine entertainment,
onless it’s fishing for sharks, which is exciting
at times. I’m pleased to have met up with this school,
though, for it’s allers comforting to run across fresh
proofs of my friend old Kite Roberson’s knowingness.
He useter say consarning the critters, Kite did,
that wolves was sharks and sharks was wolves, and
that neither of ’em warn’t no fit playthings for children;
which it now seems to me he were correct, as
usual.”</p>

<p>“He certainly was,” replied Phil, who, leaning on
his rifle, was thoughtfully regarding the shaggy beast
that Kite Roberson’s friend had just dragged into
camp. “But aren’t these uncommonly big wolves?
I never knew they grew so large.”</p>

<p>“They don’t generally,” answered Serge; “but these
are of the same breed as the great Siberian wolves,
which, you know, are noted as being the largest and
fiercest in the world.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder now that the dogs were frightened,”
continued Phil, “for this fellow looks twice as big as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Amook, and he’s no puppy. But I say, Serge, you’re
an awfully plucky chap. As for myself, I must confess
I was so badly rattled that I don’t believe I should
have even thought of a gun before they were on us a
second time.”</p>

<p>“If they had made a second rush not one of us
would be alive to talk about it now,” remarked Serge,
soberly; “and it was only the promptness of our attack
that upset their plans. In dealing with wolves it
is always safest to force the fighting; for while they
are awful bullies, they are cowards at heart, like all
bullies I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“Captain Duff, for instance,” said Phil, with a reminiscent
smile. Then he added: “Anyhow, old man,
you got us out of a bad scrape, for it isn’t every fellow
who would know just how to deal with a pack of
wolves, especially when wakened from a sound sleep
to find them piling on top of him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was quite as bad as that,” objected
Serge. “I expect only the dogs piled on top of
us when they were driven in. By-the-way, did you
know that four of them were killed, and several others
pretty badly hurt?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” cried Phil, in dismay. “What ones
are killed?”</p>

<p>“Two from my team, one from yours, and one from
Chitsah’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the villains!” exclaimed the young leader.
“Another victory like that would cripple us. Do you
think there is any danger of them coming back?”</p>

<p>“Not just now; but I shouldn’t be surprised to hear
from them again to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’m glad you mentioned it. Now we’ll
see if we can’t have an interesting reception prepared
for them.”</p>

<p>“Pizen?” queried Jalap Coombs, who had lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
his pipe and was now complacently watching the skinning
of the dead wolves, which had been undertaken
by the three Indians.</p>

<p>“Worse than that,” answered Phil, significantly.</p>

<p>By the time the Indians had finished their task and
breakfast had been eaten the usual starting-hour had
arrived. Two of the wolf-skins were allotted to the
guide, who was to leave them at this point, and he set
forth on his return journey with them on his back.
Rolled in them were the single dried salmon which
would form his sole sustenance on the journey, and
the cherished pound of tobacco, for which he had been
willing to work so hard. In his hand he bore an old
flintlock musket that was the pride of his heart, not
so much on account of its shooting qualities, which
were very uncertain, as by reason of its great length.
It was the longest gun known to the dwellers of the
Tanana Valley, and consequently the most valuable;
for the Hudson Bay Company’s method of selling such
guns was to exchange one for as many marten, fox, or
beaver skins as could be piled from stock to muzzle
when it stood upright.</p>

<p>“I hope the wolves won’t attack his camps,” remarked
Phil, as they watched the lonely figure pass
out of sight on the back trail.</p>

<p>“Him no camp,” declared Kurilla.</p>

<p>“But he must. Why, it’s a four-days’ journey to
his home.”</p>

<p>“No; one day, one night. Him no stop. Wolf no
catch um. Yaas.”</p>

<p>And Kurilla was right, for the Indian would push
on over mile after mile of that frozen solitude without
a pause, save for an occasional bite from his dried
salmon, and a handful of snow to wash it down, until
he reached his own far-away home.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>CHITSAH’S NATURAL TELEPHONE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Seventeen green wolf-skins formed a heavy sledge-load,
especially for the weakened dog-teams; but fortunately
Jalap Coombs’s feet were again in condition
for walking, and snow on the river was not yet deep.
So it was determined to carry them—at least, for the
present. On the evening following that of the encounter
with the wolves, Phil, leaving the work of
preparing camp to the others, unpacked the Eskimo
wolf-traps of compressed whalebone that he had procured
at Makagamoot. He had twenty of the ingenious
little contrivances, and wrapped each one in a
strip of frozen wolf-meat that he had saved and brought
along for the purpose. When all were thus prepared,
he carried them about a quarter of a mile from camp,
and then dropped them at short intervals in a great
circle about it. He knew the dogs would not stray
that far since their experience of the night before, and
so felt pretty certain that the traps would only find
their way to the destination for which they were intended.</p>

<p>The first blood-chilling howl was heard soon after
dark, and a few minutes later it was apparent that
wolves were again gathering from all quarters. Then
the anxious watchers caught occasional glimpses of
dim forms, and sometimes of a pair of gleaming eyes,
that invariably drew a shot from Phil’s rifle. Still the
wolves seemed to remember their lesson, or else they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
waited for the occupants of the camp to fall asleep, for
they made no effort at an attack.</p>

<p>As time passed the wolf tones began to change, and
defiant howlings to give place to yelps and yells of
distress. Soon other sounds were mingled with these—the
fierce snarlings of savage beasts fighting over their
prey. The traps were doing their work. Those wolves
that had eagerly gulped them down were so stricken
with deadly pains that they staggered, fell, and rolled
in the snow. At the first symptoms of distress others
sprang upon them and tore them in pieces, at the same
time battling fiercely over their cannibal feast. So
wolf fed wolf, while the night echoed with their hideous
outcries, until finally the survivors, gorged with
the flesh of their own kind, slunk away, and after
some hours of bedlam quiet once more reigned in the
forest.</p>

<p>So Phil’s scheme proved a success, and for the remainder
of that night he and his companions slept in
peace. At daylight they visited the scenes of wolfish
feasting, and found everywhere plentiful evidence of
what had taken place; but this time they gathered in
neither rugs nor robes, for only blood-stains, bones,
and tattered shreds of fur remained.</p>

<p>Phil’s only regret was that he had not a lot more of
those same useful traps, though, as was afterwards
proved, they were not needed, for never again during
their journey did wolves appear in sufficient numbers
to cause them any alarm.</p>

<p>For another week did the sledge party journey down
the several streams that, emptying one into another,
finally formed the Conehill River, or, as the gold-diggers
call it, Forty Mile Creek, because its mouth is
forty miles down the Yukon from the old trading-post
of Fort Reliance. As the first half of their long journey
drew towards a close they became anxious as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
its results and impatient for its end. When would
they reach the settlement? and could they get there
before their rivals who had followed the Yukon? were
the two questions that they constantly asked of each
other, but which none could answer.</p>

<p>Phil grew almost despondent as he reflected upon
the length of time since they left old Fort Adams, and
gave it as his opinion that the other party must have
reached Forty Mile long since.</p>

<p>Serge also feared they had, though he didn’t see how
they could.</p>

<p>Jalap Coombs was firm in his belief that the other
party was still far away, and that his would be the
first in; for, quoth he, “Luck allers has been on my
side, and I’m going to believe it allers will be. My
old friend Kite Roberson useter say, speaking of luck,
and he give it as his own experience, that them as
struck the best kinds of luck was them as worked the
hardest for it; and ef they didn’t get it one way they
was sure to another. Likewise he useter say, Kite did,
consarning worriments, that ef ye didn’t pay no attention
to one ’twould be mighty apt to pass ye by; but
ef ye encouraged it by so much as a wink or a nod,
ye’d have to fight it to git red of it. So, seeing as
they hain’t no worriments hove in sight yet, what’s the
use in s’arching for ’em?”</p>

<p>As for Kurilla, whenever his opinion was asked, he
always grinned and returned the same answer:</p>

<p>“You come pretty quick, mebbe. Yaas.”</p>

<p>So each day of the last three or four brought its
fresh hope; at each succeeding bend of the stream all
eyes were strained eagerly forward for a sight of the
expected cluster of log-huts, and each night brought
an added disappointment.</p>

<p>At length one evening, when Phil, who had pushed
on longer than usual, in an effort to end their suspense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
was reluctantly compelled, by gathering darkness, to
go into camp, Chitsah suddenly attracted attention to
himself by running to a tree and pressing an ear to its
trunk. As the others stared at him, a broad smile
overspread his face, and he said something to his father,
which the latter instantly interpreted.</p>

<p>“What?” cried Phil, incredulously. “He thinks
he hears the sound of chopping?”</p>

<p>“Yaas,” answered Kurilla. “Axe, chop um, white
men, plenty. Yaas.”</p>

<p>“I, too, can hear something!” exclaimed Serge,
who had imitated Chitsah’s movements, “though I
wouldn’t swear it was chopping.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! So can I!” shouted Phil, after a moment
of intent listening at another tree. “First time, though,
I ever knew that the public telephone service was extended
to this country. The sound I heard might be
a train of cars twenty miles away, or a woodpecker
somewhere within sight. No matter. If Chitsah says
it’s chopping, it must be, for he ought to know, seeing
that he first heard it with the aid of the tree-telephone.
So let’s go for it. We can afford to travel an
hour or two in the dark for the sake of meeting the
white man who is swinging that axe, can’t we?”</p>

<p>“Of course we can,” replied Serge.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” answered Jalap Coombs.</p>

<p>“Mebbe catch um. Yaas,” added Kurilla, sharing
the general enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Even the tired dogs barked, pricked up their sharp
ears, sniffed the air, and did not, seemingly, object to
moving on.</p>

<p>So the long teams were again swung into line, the pistol-like
reports of the three sledge-whips rang sharply
through the keen air, and the whole party swept on
down the darkening river at a greater speed than they
had made that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour later, as they rounded a projecting point,
Phil uttered an exulting shout. A cluster of twinkling
lights shone dead ahead, and our travellers knew
that their goal was won.</p>

<p>“Let’s give them a volley,” suggested Serge. “It’s
the custom of the country, you know.”</p>

<p>So the guns were taken from their deerskin coverings,
and at Phil’s word of command a roar from double-barrel,
flintlock, and Winchester woke glad echoes
from both sides of the broad valley and from the rugged
Yukon cliffs beyond. Then, with whoopings and
cheers and frantic yelpings of dogs, the sledge brigade
dashed on towards the welcoming lights.</p>

<p>“Hello the camp!” yelled Phil, as they approached
the dark cluster of cabins.</p>

<p>“On deck!” roared Jalap Coombs, as though he
were hailing a ship at sea.</p>

<p>“Hello yourself!” answered a gruff voice—the first
hail in their own tongue that the boys had heard in
many a week. “Who are you? Where do you come
from? And what’s all this racket about?”</p>

<p>“White men,” replied Phil, “with dog-sledges, up
from Yukon mouth.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! You don’t say so! No wonder you’re
noisy! Hi, boys! Here’s the first winter outfit that
ever came from Yukon mouth to Forty Mile. What’s
the matter with giving them a salute?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all!” cried a score of voices, and then
volley after volley rang forth, until it seemed as
though every man there must have carried a loaded
gun and emptied it of all six shots in honor of the
occasion.</p>

<p>Men came running from all directions, and before
the shooting ceased the entire population of the camp,
some three hundred in number, were eagerly crowding
about the new-comers, plying them with questions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and struggling for the honor of shaking hands with
the first arrivals of the year.</p>

<p>“Are we really the first to come up the river?”
asked Phil.</p>

<p>“To be sure you are. Not only that, but the first
to reach the diggings from any direction since navigation
closed. But how did you come? Not by the
river, I know, for when I heard your shooting ’twas
clear away up the creek.”</p>

<p>“We came by the Tanana and across the Divide,”
answered Phil. “There is another party coming by
way of the river, though, and we were afraid they
might get in ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Hark to that, boys! One train just arrived, and
another coming! I tell you, old Forty Mile is right
in it. Daily express from all points, through tickets
to Europe, Arup, and Arrap; morning papers and opera-houses,
circus and theaytres. Looks like the boom
had struck us at last. But say, stranger, what <em>is</em> the
news from below?”</p>

<p>“New steamer on her way up the river, with saw-mill,
mining machinery, and best stock of goods ever
seen in Alaska,” replied Phil, quick to seize the opportunity,
and anxious to make his business known while
he still had the field to himself. “We have come
from her, and are on our way to San Francisco to
send up a new stock for next season. So we have
only stopped to take your orders and find out what
will be the most acceptable.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled the crowd, wild with excitement.
“Send us a brass-band,” shouted one. “In swaller-tails
and white kids,” added another. “What’s the
matter with moving the Palace Hotel up here?” suggested
a third, “seeing as San Francisco isn’t in it any
longer with Forty Mile. Especially send along the
café.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, fellows, let up,” cried the man who had
been the first to welcome the new arrivals, and whose
name was Riley. “We mustn’t keep these gentlemen
standing out here in the cold any longer. I reckon
they’re hungry, too, and wondering why we don’t
invite ’em to grub. So, men, just come into my shebang
and make yourselves at home. There isn’t much
to it, but such as it is it’s yours, so long as you’ll honor
yours truly.”</p>

<p>“No, come with me,” cried another voice. “I’ve
got beans, Boston baked, fresh from the can.” “I’ve
got molasses and soft-tack,” and “I’ve just made a dish
of scouse,” “Come with us,” shouted others.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” roared Mr. Riley. “They’re my
meat, and they are going to bunk in with me. But,
boys, you can send along your beans and your dope
and your scouse, and whatever else comes handy, for
I’ve only got roast beef and chicken-salad and a few
terrapin, and we want to do this thing up in style.
So, ‘all small contributions thankfully received’ is the
word, and if we don’t scare up just the niftiest spread
on the coast this night then my name isn’t Platt Riley,
that’s all.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>A YUKON MINING CAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The supper provided by the hospitable miners was a
good one, and heartily did our travellers enjoy it; but
while they are appeasing the extraordinary appetites
that they acquired somewhere in the Alaskan wilderness,
let us take a look at this most northern of American
mining camps.</p>

<p>To begin with, although it is at the junction of Forty
Mile Creek and the Yukon River, it is not in Alaska,
but about twenty miles east of the boundary in Northwest
Territory, which is one of the subdivisions of Canada.
The most recent name of this camp is “Mitchell,”
but all old Yukon miners know it as Camp Forty Mile.
At the time of Phil Ryder’s visit it contained nearly
two hundred log-cabins, two stores, including the one
that he established in the name of his friend Gerald
Hamer, two saloons, both of which were closed for the
season, and a small cigar factory. Although the winter
population was only about three hundred, in summer-time
it is much larger, as many of the miners come
out in the fall and return before the 15th of June, at
which date, according to Yukon mining law, every man
owning a claim must be on the ground, or it may be
“jumped.”</p>

<p>Forty Mile is what is known as a placer camp, which
means that its gold is found in minute particles or
“dust” in soft earth, from which it can be washed in
sluices or rockers. Into one of these a stream of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
is turned that sweeps away all the dirt and gravel, allowing
the heavier gold to sink to the bottom, where it
is caught and held by cross-bars or “riffles.”</p>

<p>Although gold has been discovered at many points
along the Yukon and its branches, the deposit at Forty
Mile is the richest yet worked, and has paid as high as
three hundred dollars to a man for a single day’s labor.
Twelve thousand dollars’ worth of gold was cleared by
one miner in a three months’ season, and a five-hundred-dollar
nugget has been found; but most of the
miners are content if they can make “ounce wages,”
or sixteen dollars per day, while the average for the
camp is not over eight dollars per day during the short
season of that arctic region.</p>

<p>Sluices can only be worked during three or four
months of summer-time; then come the terrible eight
or nine months of winter when the mercury thinks
nothing of dropping to sixty or seventy degrees below
zero, and the whole world seems made of ice. Strange
as it may appear, the summer weather of this region is
very hot, eighty-five degrees in the shade and one hundred
and twelve degrees in the sun being frequently
reached by the mercury. During the summer months,
too, the entire Yukon Valley is as terribly infested with
mosquitoes as is any mangrove swamp of the tropics.
Thus the hardy miner who penetrates it in his search
for gold is made to suffer from one cause or another
during every month of the year.</p>

<p>In spite of the summer heat the ground never thaws
to a depth of more than five or six feet, below which
it is solidly frozen beyond any point yet reached by
digging. Under the dense covering of moss, six to
eighteen inches thick, by which the greater part of
Alaska is overspread, it does not thaw more than a few
inches. Consequently the most important item of a
Yukon miner’s winter work is the stripping of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
moss from his claim in order that next summer’s sun
may have a chance to thaw it to working depth.</p>

<p>There were no women nor children at Forty Mile,
and there were very few amusements, but there is
plenty of hard work in both summer, when the sun
hardly sets at all, and in the winter, when he barely
shows his face above the southern horizon. Besides
the laborious task of moss-stripping, the miner must
saw out by hand all lumber for sluices and rockers.
He must build his own cabin and fashion its rude furniture,
besides doing all of his own house-work and
cooking. He also expects to do a certain amount of
hunting and trapping during the winter months, so
that his time, unless he be very lazy, is fully occupied.
But lazy men are not apt to reach Forty Mile, for the
journey from Juneau, in southern Alaska, which is the
largest city in the Territory, as well as the nearest
outfitting point for the diggings, is so filled with peril
and the roughest kind of hard work as to deter any but
men of the most determined energy.</p>

<p>At Juneau, Yukon travellers provide themselves
with an outfit of snow-shoes, sledges, tents, fur clothing,
provisions, and whatever else seems to them necessary.
Starting in the early spring, they proceed by
boat to the Chilkat country, seventy miles distant, and
to the head of Chilkoot Inlet. From there they set forth
on a terrible mountain climb over snow many feet in
depth, where they are in constant danger from avalanches,
and cross the coast range by a pass that rises
three thousand feet above timber-line. On the opposite
side they strike the head-waters of the Yukon,
which they follow through a series of six lakes, sledging
over their still ice-bound waters, and rafting down
their connecting links, in which are seething rapids,
dark gorges, and roaring cañons, around which all
goods must be carried on men’s backs. After some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
two hundred miles of these difficulties have been
passed, trees must be felled, lumber sawed out, and
boats constructed for the remaining five hundred miles
of the weary journey.</p>

<p>As it would not pay to transport freight by this
route, all provisions and other supplies for the diggings
are shipped from San Francisco by sea to St.
Michaels, where they are transferred to small river
steamers like the <i>Chimo</i>, and so, after being many
months on the way, finally reach their destination. By
this time their value has become so enhanced or “enchanted,”
as the miners say, that Phil Ryder found
flour selling for $30 per barrel, bacon at 35 cents per
pound, beans at 25 cents per pound, canned fruit at 60
cents per pound, coarse flannel shirts at $8 each, rubber
boots at $18 per pair, and all other goods at proportionate
rates. Even sledge dogs, such as he had
purchased at Anvik for $5 or $6 each, were here valued
at $25 apiece.</p>

<p>In view of these facts it is no wonder that the news
of another steamer on the river bringing a saw-mill to
supply them with lumber, machinery with which to
work the frozen but gold-laden earth of their claims,
and a large stock of goods to be sold at about one-half
the prevailing prices, created a very pleasant excitement
among the miners of that wide-awake camp.</p>

<p>On the day following his arrival, and after a careful
survey of the situation, Phil rented the largest building
in the place, paying one month’s rent in advance,
and giving its owner an order on Gerald Hamer for
the balance until the time of the <i>Chimo’s</i> arrival. This
building had been used as a saloon, and was conveniently
located close by the steamboat-landing facing
the river. Into it the sledge party moved all their belongings,
including the seventeen wolf-skins, which now
formed rugs for their floor as well as coverings for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
split-log benches. Serge and the two Indians at
once started up the river with the sledges for a supply
of firewood, which was a precious article in Forty Mile
at that time, leaving Phil and Jalap Coombs to clean
the new quarters and render them habitable. While
the latter, with a sailor’s neat deftness, attended to
this work, Phil busied himself with a pot of black paint
and a long breadth of cotton cloth. At this he labored
with such diligence that in an hour’s time a huge sign
appeared above the entrance to the building and
stretched across its entire front. On it, in letters so
large that they could be plainly read from the river,
was painted the legend, “Yukon Trading Company,
Gerald Hamer, Agent.”</p>

<p>This promise of increased business facilities was
greeted by a round of hearty cheers from a group of
miners who had assembled to witness the raising of
the new sign, and when Jalap Coombs finished tacking
up his end one of these stepped up to him with a
keen scrutiny. Finally he said, “Stranger, may I be
so bold as to ask who was the best friend you ever
had?”</p>

<p>“Sartain you may,” replied the sailor-man, “seeing
as I’m allers proud to mention the name of old Kite
Roberson, and likewise claim him for a friend.”</p>

<p>“I thought so!” cried the delighted miner, thrusting
out a great hairy paw. “I thought I couldn’t be
mistook in that figger-head, and I knowed if you was
the same old Jalap I took ye to be that Kite Roberson
wouldn’t be fur off. <a href="#i_fp140">Why, matey, don’t you remember
the old brig <i>Betsy</i>?</a> Have you clean forgot
Skiff Bettens?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_fp140">
  <img src="images/i_fp140.jpg" width="600" height="557" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_140">“WHY, MATEY, DON’T YOU REMEMBER THE OLD BRIG ‘BETSY’?”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Him that went into the hold and found the fire
and put it out, and was drug up so nigh dead from
smoke that he didn’t breathe nateral agin fur a week?
Not much I hain’t forgot him, and I’m nigh about as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
glad to see him as if he were old Kite hisself!” exclaimed
Jalap Coombs, in joyous tones. Then he introduced
Mr. Skiff Bettens, ex-sailor and now Yukon
miner, to Phil, and pulled him into the house, and
there was no more work to be got out of Jalap
Coombs that day.</p>

<p>Phil had also been recognized. That is, Mr. Platt
Riley had asked him if he were the son of his father,
and when Phil admitted the relationship, told him that
he had a father to be proud of every minute of his life.
Didn’t he know? for hadn’t he, Platt Riley, worked
side by side with Mr. John Ryder prospecting in South
Africa, where every ounce of grit that a white man had
in him was bound to show itself? “To be certain
he had,” and now he was proud to shake the hand of
John Ryder’s son, and if there was anything John
Ryder’s son wanted in that camp, why he, Platt Riley,
was the man to get it for him.</p>

<p>So our sledge travellers found that even in that
remote mining camp, buried from the world beneath
the snows of an arctic winter, they were among friends.
This, coupled with all that they had undergone in
reaching it, made it seem to them a very pleasant and
comfortable place in which to rest awhile.</p>

<p>And it was necessary that they should stay there for
a time. They must cultivate friendly business relations
with the miners on Gerald Hamer’s account, and
find out what class of goods were most in demand;
for never until now had Phil realized the responsibility
with which he had been intrusted. He must prepare
a full report to send back by Kurilla and Chitsah, who
could not be tempted to venture any farther away
from their homes. The dogs must be well rested before
they would be fitted for the second and most difficult
half of the long journey. Above all, Phil felt
that, as representative of the Yukon Trading Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he must be on hand to meet the agents of its
old-established rival, and defend his far-away friend
from the false reports they were certain to spread concerning
him.</p>

<p>He wondered why Goldollar and Strengel did not
appear, and dreaded to meet them, but at the same
time longed to have the disagreeable encounter over
with as quickly as possible. So, many times each day
did he gaze long and fixedly across the broad white
plain of the Yukon. At length, on the eighth day after
their arrival at Forty Mile, his eye was caught by
some moving black dots that he felt certain must be
the expected sledges.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>THE NEW ARRIVAL AT FORTY MILE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The man known as Strengel was probably as great
a rascal as could be found in all Alaska. His sole
object in shipping aboard the steamer <i>Norsk</i> at San
Francisco had been to make his way, by fair means or
foul, to the Yukon gold-fields, of which he had gained
extravagant ideas. On the night before the <i>Norsk</i> left
St. Michaels he stole from the chests of several of his
shipmates such small sums of money as they contained,
slipped into a canoe, and deserted the ship. He remained
in hiding until she sailed, and then, claiming
to have been discharged at his own request, offered his
services to Gerald Hamer in exchange for a passage to
Forty Mile. This proposition being accepted, and
Strengel regularly shipped as one of the <i>Chimo’s</i>
crew, he made a secret proposal to the old company
through one of its clerks, who happened to be Simon
Goldollar, to so delay and cripple Gerald Hamer’s expedition
that he should be forced to abandon it. In
attempting to carry out this programme he was foiled
by Phil Ryder’s quick wit and prompt action.</p>

<p>Making his way back to St. Michaels, after Phil set
him ashore at the Pastolik wood-yard, Strengel fell in
with Jalap Coombs, and, in company with Goldollar,
so managed the money affairs of that unsuspecting
sailor that he was unwittingly made to defray all their
expenses to Forty Mile, though he only expected to
accompany them a short distance up the river. Strengel’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
sole object was still to reach the gold-fields,
while Goldollar was intent on winning a reputation
for himself by forestalling Gerald Hamer at Forty
Mile, and at the same time inflicting what injury he
could on Phil Ryder. From the outset they agreed
to rid themselves of Jalap Coombs at some point so
far up the river that he must necessarily remain where
they left him for the rest of the winter. They learned
at Nulato that the <i>Chimo</i> was frozen in at Anvik, but
took care that this information should not reach Jalap
Coombs, whom they soon afterwards so cruelly deserted.</p>

<p>As they travelled beyond the point where they left
him, the well-mated pair had such frequent and bitter
quarrels that, when Simon Goldollar fell seriously ill,
Strengel did not hesitate to rob him of what money he
carried and desert him at a native village near the
abandoned trading-post of Fort Yukon. Before doing
this he discharged the Indians who had come with
them from Nulato, and sent them back, telling them
that he should remain with his sick friend until he recovered
or died. As soon as they were gone he engaged
other natives, and set out for the diggings that
had for so long been the goal of his desires.</p>

<p>He planned to enter Forty Mile under a new name,
and as a traveller from one of the interior Hudson
Bay trading-posts, who was ignorant of the lower Yukon,
its people, and its happenings. He was confident
that Jalap Coombs would never appear to contradict
him, and almost equally certain that Simon Goldollar
would never reach Forty Mile. If by a miracle he
should recover from his illness, he was helpless to continue
his journey before the boats came up in the summer,
by which time the man who had robbed and deserted
him would be lost to sight amid the season’s
rush of prospectors. In the meantime he had plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of money to live on until he should meet with an opportunity
for making a strike of some kind.</p>

<p>Thus it was that on a pleasant day of late January
Mr. Strengel approached the mining camp of Forty Mile,
riding comfortably in Jalap Coombs’s own sledge, with
a light heart and no intimation of aught but an agreeable
reception by its citizens. But in all his carefully-worked-out
plans he had made several miscalculations.</p>

<p>It had never occurred to him that there was any
other route than the one he had followed by which
this point might be reached from the lower river.
Nor did he believe it possible that any word of Gerald
Hamer’s expedition could have come up the river
unknown to him. Finally, his gravest mistake lay in
supposing the population of this camp to be of the
same lawless class as is to be found in most Western
mining camps, and believing that here he should meet
only with as great rascals as himself. In this he displayed
great ignorance of Forty Mile, which was
wholly in the hands of honorable old-time miners,
who had framed a simple set of laws for the regulation
of their isolated little community that they were
determined should be respected. They had chosen
one of their own number as judge, and from his decisions
they allowed no appeal. They had also elected
a marshal, whom they loyally assisted in the discharge
of his duties. Several lawless characters had already
been driven from the camp, and many others warned
not to venture within its limits.</p>

<p>As Forty Mile had received warning of the expected
coming of Goldollar and Strengel, and had learned
many interesting things concerning the previous history
of these gentlemen, their arrival was eagerly
anticipated. Thus, upon Phil Ryder’s announcement
that sledges were coming up the river, an expectant
throng was quickly gathered at the landing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Strengel fired several shots from his rifle as he
drew near, and was surprised that his salute was not
answered in kind. He was, of course, gratified to observe
the sensation that his approach was creating, and
undertook to arouse some enthusiasm among the silent
spectators by yelling, “Hurrah for Forty Mile! Hurrah
for the diggings! Hurrah for our side!” Then,
as his sledge reached the bank and he sprang out, he
cried, in tones meant to convey hearty good-fellowship:</p>

<p>“How are you, boys? You bet I’m mighty glad
to see white men again after camping with a lot of
low-lived Injuns for more than two months. You see,
I’ve just come down from Pierre’s House on the Porcupine.
My name’s Bradwick, and—”</p>

<p>Here the speaker’s fluent words seemed suddenly to
fail him, his face turned pale, and his eyes were fixed
in a bewildered stare. He had caught sight of the
Yukon Trading Company’s sign.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” he laughed, recovering himself with an
effort. “Seeing the name of an old friend who’s long
since dead kinder give me a turn. But, as I was saying—”</p>

<p>“Yes, you were just about to tell us what had become
of Goldollar,” interrupted Mr. Platt Riley, who
had received word from Phil that the new-comer was
Strengel.</p>

<p>“Goldollar!” stammered the stranger, at the same
time starting as though he had been shot. “Goldollar!”
he repeated, reflectively; “I don’t know the
name; never heard it before in my life. I think I
mentioned that I’d just come down from Pierre’s House
on the Porcupine, and hadn’t seen a white man since
leaving there. There wasn’t no one of that name at
Pierre’s House when I left. What do you mean? Who
is Goldollar, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“He’s a feller that we heard was coming up from below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
with a dog train,” replied Mr. Riley, deliberately,
at the same time gazing full in Strengel’s face. “And
we didn’t know but what you and him might have met
up and concluded to travel together.”</p>

<p>“How could you hear of him?” inquired the new-comer.
“I didn’t know there was any way for news
to reach Forty Mile in the winter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we might have heard by mail, or telegraph,
or seen it in the daily papers, or a dozen other ways.
Anyhow, we did hear it, and that another feller was
along with him. So of course when we saw you coming
up the river—”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hear that the other fellow’s name was
Bradwick, did you?” interrupted the stranger.</p>

<p>“No, that wasn’t the name. It wasn’t so good a
name as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you didn’t hear that I was coming with
him; for Bradwick’s my name, and I don’t know nothing
about any Goldollars, though I hope to find out
something about them right here in these diggings,”
replied Mr. Strengel, boldly, and with attempted jocularity.
“Now, seeing that I’m tired, and cold, and
hungry,” he added, “supposing we adjourn to some
place that’s warmer than out here in the snow, and
better suited for making acquaintances.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Mr. Platt Riley, who, possessed
of a keen sense of humor, was disposed to prolong the
farce that promised so much entertainment. “We
don’t know much about Goldollars ourselves, but we’ll
try and teach you all we do know, and at the same
time put you in the way of meeting acquaintances.
As you say, though, this is a cold place for talking,
so I suppose you might as well come up to my select
family boarding-house for the night, seeing as it ain’t
overcrowded just at present. Then in the morning
we’ll look round for a place that’ll suit you better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>So the new-comer walked away with Mr. Platt Riley,
while the spectators of this interesting meeting chuckled
and winked significantly, poked each other in the ribs,
and remarked:</p>

<p>“Ain’t the jedge a honey-cooler, though? He ain’t
the kind that’ll hang a man first and try him afterwards.
Not much; that ain’t his style. Fair play’s
his motter, and turn the rascals out every time.”</p>

<p>It is needless to say that during the interview just
described Phil, Serge, and Jalap kept themselves out
of sight; nor had any one let fall an intimation of
their presence in the camp.</p>

<p>All that evening a constant stream of visitors flowed
in and out of Mr. Platt Riley’s cabin. Each wore an
expression of expectancy and suppressed mirth, and
each bowed gravely, without trusting himself to speak,
when introduced to Mr. “Bradwick.” It was also to
be noticed that none of them shook hands with him.
When he complained of this to his host he was gravely
informed that hand-shaking was not one of the customs
of the camp. All the visitors listened with great interest
to his glib talk of the Porcupine and of other
regions to the eastward, while some even went so far
as to express regret that he had not met their friend
Goldollar.</p>

<p>He always turned the conversation at this point;
nor did he again refer to the name of his dead friend
that had confronted him on the sign of the Yukon
Trading Company. At the same time it caused him a
great deal of uneasiness, and led him to think seriously
of shortening his stay in the camp to a single night.</p>

<p>When he, in turn, inquired about the prospects of
the diggings, and learned that most claims had to be
stripped of frozen moss and thawed out before they
could be worked, he declared that he’d see the whole
country and its gold in Jericho before he’d strip moss,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which he denounced as work only fit for “Injuns” and
convicts.</p>

<p>On the whole, his impressions of Camp Forty Mile
were so unpleasant that he fully determined to get his
dog teams in motion the very next day, and push on
farther up the river. It was only upon the urgent request
of Mr. Platt Riley that he consented to delay his
departure long enough to attend a public meeting of
the greatest interest to all Yukon miners, that was to
be held the first thing in the morning.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>LAW IN THE GOLD DIGGINGS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The latest comer to Camp Forty Mile was not particularly
anxious to attend the public meeting to which
he was invited by Mr. Platt Riley. Still he thought it
better to do so rather than run the risk of offending
his host, who was evidently a man of influence in the
diggings. His overnight reflections having convinced
him that this camp was not such a place as he had expected,
and also that he might find greater safety elsewhere,
his first act in the morning was to order his
Indian drivers to harness the dogs and be prepared for
a start within an hour.</p>

<p>Kurilla, who was with them under instructions not
to lose sight of them, grinned when he heard this, for
he had picked up an inkling of what was going on,
and felt pretty certain that the order need not be
obeyed.</p>

<p>When Mr. Riley’s reluctant guest entered the store
of the Yukon Trading Company, in which, on account
of its size, the meeting was to be held, he fully intended
to take a back seat and slip out as soon as he could
do so unnoticed. The place was so filled with miners,
however, that there were no back seats, and, to his
surprise, the crowd pressed aside as he and Mr. Riley
entered, so as to leave a passage to the farther end of
the room. A moment later, without knowing just how
it had been done, he found himself seated beside Jalap
Coombs’s friend, Skiff Bettens, who obligingly made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
place for him. He noticed, with some curiosity, that
twelve men were seated on benches directly opposite
to him, while all the rest of the crowd were standing.
Between him and these men was an open space, at the
upper end of which were a table and a chair raised on
a rude platform.</p>

<p>To this platform Mr. Platt Riley made his way, and
seating himself in the chair, rapped on the table for
silence. Then rising, he said:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of the jury and fellow-citizens,—This
court is now open for business, and I as its judge, elected
by your votes, am prepared to administer justice in
accordance with your laws and such verdicts as may
be rendered by your jury.”</p>

<p>“It is a court,” thought Strengel, with a shiver.</p>

<p>“The case to be tried this morning,” continued the
judge, “is one that touches the pocket, the life, and
the honor of every miner in the Yukon Valley, for the
prisoner at the bar is indicted on three separate counts
as a thief, a murderer, and an unmitigated scoundrel.
He has come into our camp under a false name and with
a false story, after having attempted the destruction of
a steamer that is bringing goods and machinery of
which we are greatly in need.</p>

<p>“He is charged with robbing and leaving helpless in
the wilderness a man whom we all know and respect,
and also with robbing and deserting while seriously ill
his own companion, who was on his way to visit us in
behalf of our old-established trading company.”</p>

<p>Strengel listened to these terrible words with an
ever-increasing paleness and visible agitation. Finally,
clapping a hand to his face, as though seized with a
sudden illness, he started to rise and leave the room.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” ordered Skiff Bettens in a low tone, at
the same time jerking him back to his seat. Then the
man knew that he was indeed a prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“To prove these serious charges,” continued the
judge, “I am about to call several witnesses. At the
same time the prisoner will be given the privilege of
cross-questioning them, and of pleading in his own behalf.
Mr. Philip Ryder.”</p>

<p>At this summons Phil advanced from the farther end
of the room, and the prisoner regarded him with undisguised
amazement.</p>

<p>After answering the usual questions regarding his
personality and business, Phil was asked if he knew
the prisoner.</p>

<p>“I do,” he answered.</p>

<p>“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“I understand that he now calls himself Bradwick,
but a few months ago he went by the name of Strengel.”</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp152">“That’s a lie!” shouted the prisoner, hoarsely.</a></p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_152">“THAT’S A LIE!” SHOUTED THE PRISONER, HOARSELY</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Silence!” commanded the judge. “Now Mr.
Ryder, tell the jury what you know concerning the accused
from the time of your first meeting with him up
to the present.”</p>

<p>This Phil did as briefly as possible, and when he had
finished the prisoner sprang to his feet, his face black
with rage, and exclaimed: “Why should this fellow’s
story be believed rather than mine? Who knows anything
about him, or even who he is? He was picked
up in Bering Sea, drifting about in a stolen canoe. At
St. Michaels he was known as a thief and a brawler. I
happen to know that he has been locked up in a Victoria
police-station, and I demand that his evidence be
thrown out.”</p>

<p>“That will do, sir,” said the judge. “I happen to
know this young man and his family so well that I am
willing to vouch for him if necessary. Do you wish
to question him? No? Then we will proceed. Mr.
Serge Belcofsky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Serge, of course, identified the prisoner as Strengel,
and corroborated Phil’s story in every detail.</p>

<p>“This ends the testimony on the first charge,” announced
the judge when Serge had finished, and the
prisoner sullenly declined to question him. “In proof
of the second charge, that of robbery and desertion, I
call as witness Mr. Jalap Coombs.”</p>

<p>As the ex-mate of the <i>Seamew</i> advanced to the stand
the prisoner stared at him as though he were a ghost,
nor could he imagine by what miracle this witness
had reached Forty Mile in time to appear against
him.</p>

<p>Jalap Coombs told his story in his own picturesque
language, but in a perfectly straightforward manner,
and without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>When he finished, the judge questioned him very
closely as to the amount of money given him by Mr.
John Ryder, and the prices paid for various articles of
his outfit at St. Michaels.</p>

<p>As a defence against this charge the prisoner claimed
that Jalap Coombs had not been deserted by Simon
Goldollar and himself, but had voluntarily turned back,
and that the dogs they had left with him had run away
to follow them much against their wishes. He also
stated that they had taken the dogs and sledge back
to the place where they last saw Jalap Coombs, but
that they could not find him.</p>

<p>“They were not his dogs, anyway, judge,” he continued,
“nor did he furnish any of our outfit except a
few provisions, most of which he traded to the Indians
on his own account. This man Coombs was a sailor,
supposed to be a deserter from some ship, and was
loafing around St. Michaels half starved when we picked
him up. He claimed to have some friends on the river
who would help him, and so we brought him along out
of charity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“May I toot a horn, jedge?” asked Mr. Skiff Bettens,
rising as the prisoner concluded his remarks.</p>

<p>“Certainly you may, marshal.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I only wanted to say that I’ve knowed Mr.
Jalap Coombs off and on for a good many years, and
in all that time I’ve never knowed him to tell a lie nor
yet do a mean thing. Moreover, I’m willing to stake
my pile on his honesty agin that of any living man,
for a better sailor, a squarer man, and a truer friend
never trod a deck.”</p>

<p>This sincere tribute so affected the simple-hearted
sailor-man that he could only stare open-mouthed at
the speaker, as though he were talking in some mysterious
language, though in after-years he often referred
to this as the proudest moment of his life. The remainder
of the audience greeted the marshal’s little speech
with an outburst of applause, which the judge was finally
obliged to check.</p>

<p>“Letting charge number two rest with the testimony
taken,” said the judge, when quiet was restored,
“we will take up charge number three, which is the
most serious of all. We have already learned that the
accused, under the name of Strengel, passed old Fort
Adams about a month ago, bound for this place in
company with a man named Goldollar, who appears to
be a pretty tough character himself, though that of
course has nothing to do with this case. The accused
at that time had little or nothing of his own, either in
the way of money or outfit, while Goldollar appears to
have been well fixed with both. Now this man turns up
in this place alone under the name of Bradwick, telling
a story about having come from up the Porcupine that he
has since admitted to be false, and in possession of the
outfit formerly owned by Mr. Coombs and Simon Goldollar.
Of course, under the circumstances, the question
naturally to be asked is, what has become of Goldollar?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“He got sick of the trip and turned back from Yukon,”
explained the prisoner, sulkily.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve heard he took sick,” replied the judge;
“but whether he turned back or was left to die in an
Indian rancheria is another question. Mr. Coombs,
will you please take the stand again?”</p>

<p>This time Jalap Coombs testified that he had carefully
examined the outfit brought into camp the night
before by the prisoner, and found it to contain the
same number of sledges, the same number of dogs, and
the identical articles, with the exception of a certain
quantity of provisions, that had composed it at old Fort
Adams.</p>

<p>“We will now call on one other witness,” announced
the judge, and the prisoner started as though he expected
to see Simon Goldollar himself appear on the
stand. What he did see was one of his own native
drivers from Fort Yukon, with Kurilla to act as interpreter.</p>

<p>“Do you admit Injun testimony in this court?” he
asked, disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Certainly we do,” replied the judge.</p>

<p>“If I’d known that,” he muttered, “I’d have
bought a dozen or so to testify on my side.”</p>

<p>The Indian’s testimony was to the effect that this
white man had left another white man in a native hut
at Fort Yukon so sick that all the Indians thought he
would die.</p>

<p>“Of course I can’t buck agin Injun testimony,”
growled the prisoner; “but I say it’s a lie, all the same,
and don’t prove nothing.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing that we must not neglect,” said
the judge. “Marshall, you may search the prisoner.”</p>

<p>The latter struggled furiously, but was overpowered
and held by strong hands while the marshall searched
his pockets. From these were produced a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
articles, including a wallet, which the judge opened,
spreading its contents on the table before him.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize anything here?” he asked of
Jalap Coombs.</p>

<p>“I can identify this as having been in Goldollar’s
possession,” answered the mate, picking up one of the
articles that had dropped from the wallet, and holding
it so that all might see.</p>

<p>Both Phil and Serge uttered exclamations of amazement,
for the object thus exhibited was nothing more
nor less than the mysteriously carved and almost forgotten
fur-seal’s tooth that had already exerted so
great an influence upon their fortunes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>REAPPEARANCE OF THE FUR-SEAL’S TOOTH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“What do you know about this thing?” asked the
judge of Jalap Coombs, taking the fur-seal’s tooth
from him and examining it curiously.</p>

<p>“I know that there were an old Eskimo at St. Michaels
what were shipped by Goldollar to go with us
to Nulato as dog-driver. He wore this bit of ivory
hung about his neck, and seemed to set a heap by it.
One time when he were looking at it I heerd Goldollar
say that by rights it belonged to him, seeing as he got
it from some natyve, and it were afterwards stole from
him. He didn’t say nothing to the Husky about it,
but when we got to Nulato he give him so much liquor
that in the morning the old chap couldn’t be woke up.
Goldollar fooled round him a while, and then saying
he’d have to give up the job of waking him, left him,
and ordered the teams to pull out. I afterwards seen
Goldollar take that very identical tooth outen his pocket
several times and look at it like it were a diamond
or some sich, and heerd him tell Strengel that any man
as owned it would surely have luck. It didn’t seem to
bring him none, though. Leastways no good luck, for
he hain’t had nothing but bad luck sence.”</p>

<p>“Was it your impression that you could win good
luck by stealing this tooth?” inquired the judge of
Strengel.</p>

<p>“I didn’t steal it,” answered the prisoner, sullenly.</p>

<p>“How did you get it, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Goldollar give it to me.”</p>

<p>“Where did you leave Goldollar?”</p>

<p>“At Fort Yukon.”</p>

<p>“Was he in good health when you last saw him?”</p>

<p>“I refuse to answer any more questions,” replied the
prisoner, suddenly realizing how deeply he was committing
himself.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the judge. “I think you have
already told enough to give us a pretty fair idea of the
particular kind of a scoundrel you are. So, if you
have nothing more to say, I declare this case closed
and in the hands of the jury. Gentlemen, the court
awaits your verdict.”</p>

<p>As there was no room to which the jury could retire,
they put their heads together and consulted in whispers,
during which time Phil told the judge what he
knew about the fur-seal’s tooth, together with the legend
of good and bad luck supposed to accompany its
possession. The spectators of the trial buzzed like a
swarm of angry hornets, and cast wrathful glances at
the prisoner who had just been proved so worthy of
their contempt.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the jury ended their conference
and resumed their places. Then, as order was restored,
the foreman, standing up, announced that they were
unanimous in finding the prisoner guilty on all three of
the charges preferred against him, and recommended
that he be so punished as to afford a warning to others
of his kind who might be contemplating a visit to the
Yukon diggings.</p>

<p>“Hang him!” cried some one in the crowd.</p>

<p>“Shoot him!” shouted another.</p>

<p>“Drive him out of camp, and set him adrift like he
done to Jalap Coombs,” suggested a third.</p>

<p>“Silence!” roared Judge Platt Riley, standing in
his place and gazing sternly about him. “You forget,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
gentlemen, that this is a court of law, and though
maybe it isn’t run with all the frills of some, it’s
bound to be respected. Likewise, it proposes to pronounce
its own decisions. In regard to the prisoner
now awaiting sentence, he has been proved by the testimony
of reputable witnesses, and by his own admissions,
to be a liar, a traitor, a dog-stealer, which in this
country is the same as a hoss-thief in the States, and
a robber of his travelling companion under circumstances
that make him at the same time come pretty
near to being a murderer. For such as he hanging
would be none too severe. But we have never yet
hanged a man in Forty Mile, and we don’t want to begin
if we can help it. The prisoner has expressed a
desire to learn something of our methods of working
these diggings, and we promised to teach him. He has
also remarked that moss-stripping was a job well suited
to convicts. So be it. Prisoner at the bar, stand up
and receive your sentence.”</p>

<p>When the wretched man, who had fancied himself in
a country where he could commit any crime without fear
of punishment, had been assisted to his feet by Marshal
Bettens and a volunteer deputy, the judge said:</p>

<p>“By a fair trial, according to Yukon law, you are
convicted of crimes such as this community does not
allow to go unpunished. On account of them you are
hereby sentenced to strip moss from the several claims
of this camp during every working-hour of every working-day
from now until such time as the first steamer
reaches here from the lower river and is ready to return.
Then you will be allowed to work your way on
her to St. Michaels, where may the agent have mercy
upon you.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, when not at work, you will be
closely confined in the camp lock-up, under guard of the
marshal, who shall be entitled to your services for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
days in every week for his trouble. On other days he
will hire you out to any miner who has moss to be
stripped, and who will pay for your keep during such
time as you may work for him.”</p>

<p>This unique but just sentence was greeted with a
murmur of approval from the spectators; but this was
quickly silenced by a frown from the judge, who continued:</p>

<p>“All the property that you brought into this camp,
including money and outfit, excepting your personal
clothing, is hereby confiscated, to be disposed of as follows:
One team of dogs, one sledge, and half the cash
found in your possession shall be restored to Mr. Jalap
Coombs, from whom you helped to steal them. The remainder
of the money, after the Indian drivers who
came with you have been paid, and one dog team shall
be devoted to the relief of Simon Goldollar, who,
though he seems to be a pretty bad lot, is still a white
man, and so must not be allowed to perish if it can be
helped. The third dog team shall become the property
of Marshal Bettens in place of a fee for his services.
The remainder of the property, provisions, and so
forth, shall be devoted to the support of the prisoner
during such times as he is working for the marshal.
Mr. Bettens will now remove his prisoner, and I hereby
declare this court adjourned.”</p>

<p>This triumph of the law and Judge Riley’s decision
gave such universal satisfaction to the spectators of that
trial that they yelled with delight as they poured from
the court-room door. They congratulated one another
on the perfection of their home-made code, and the
promptness with which its provisions were dealt out to
evil-doers.</p>

<p>From that day on every man in camp exhibited such
a lively interest in the moss-stripping operations of
Mr. Bradwick-Strengel that many times when, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
himself unobserved, he attempted to shirk his work he
was roused to renewed industry by the playful pop of
a gun, and the warning note of a bullet in close proximity
to his place of business. Thus was he given such
ample experience of gold-mining on the Yukon that
when, some months later, a boat arrived from the
lower river, he thankfully departed from Camp Forty
Mile, mentally vowing never to return.</p>

<p>After consulting with Phil, Serge, and Jalap
Coombs, Mr. Platt Riley, who objected to being called
“judge” outside of court, decided to intrust Simon
Goldollar’s rescue from the Indian village in which he
had been left to Kurilla and Chitsah, who were persuaded
by a liberal payment to return home that way.
Another Indian was hired to accompany them as far
as Fort Yukon, and bring back word to Forty Mile of
their success. If they found him alive and able to
travel, they were to carry him with them to Anvik.</p>

<p>Phil wrote and sent him a letter, in which he apologized
for having accused him of stealing his money or
the fur-seal’s tooth, Jalap Coombs having told him the
facts concerning these things, and hoped he would return
to St. Michaels in safety. Long afterwards he
learned that Simon Goldollar did make his way down
the river, aided by Kurilla and Chitsah, and was sent
on by Gerald Hamer from Anvik to St. Michaels.
There he was discharged from the company’s employ
on account of the failure of his expedition, and finally
left Alaska in the same ship that bore ex-convict
Strengel from its shores. An amusing feature of it all
was that both these rascals attributed the ill success of
their undertakings to the unlucky influence of the fur-seal’s
tooth.</p>

<p>This industrious bit of ivory, which exhibited such a
fondness for interfering with the affairs of men and
boys, as well as such activity in rapid travel and change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of ownership, reposed for several days in Mr. Platt
Riley’s vest-pocket, where it had been unconsciously
thrust and forgotten. Finally, tired of being thus neglected,
it worked a hole through the pocket and fell to
the floor. From there it was snapped up by Mr. Riley’s
favorite dog, who lay at his feet, and doubtless imagined
it to be a choice morsel provided for him by his
indulgent master. A moment later the judge was
aroused from a reverie by the frantic struggles of his
dog, who seemed on the point of strangulation. When
he succeeded, by prompt effort, in removing the obstruction
from the animal’s throat, and, with a feeling
of superstitious amazement, discovered its nature, he
started at once for the store of the Yukon Trading
Company, determined to be rid of the uncanny object
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>It so happened that none of the three occupants of
the premises was at home, nor were they to be seen in
any direction. They had been preparing for departure,
and many articles ready for packing on the sledges lay
scattered about the room. Among these was a fur
sleeping-bag, on which Mr. Riley’s eye no sooner rested
than he thrust the magic tooth into it and shook it
to the very bottom.</p>

<p>“There!” he exclaimed, “they are sure to take it
with them; one of them will find it sooner or later,
and maybe it will bring him good luck. At any rate,
I hope it will.”</p>

<p>It was now the month of February, and high time
for our travellers to be on their way if they wished to
have snow to the end of their sledge journey. Phil
had made most satisfactory business arrangements for
Gerald Hamer, had sent that gentleman a long report
of their progress to date by Kurilla, who also bore letters
from himself and Serge to their kind friends at
Anvik, and was now impatient to push forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>So on the morning of the 5th of February, although
the thermometer registered forty-eight degrees below
zero, the little party set forth from Forty Mile with
three sledges and seventeen dogs. Above the first
sledge fluttered a small flag, on which appeared the
magic letters “U. S. M.,” signifying that Phil had undertaken
to deliver on the coast a large packet of letters,
the first mail ever sent out from Forty Mile in
winter.</p>

<p>The entire population of the camp was assembled
to see them off; and amid sincere expressions of
good-will, a round of hearty cheers, and a ringing
volley the sledges dashed away up the Yukon, with
seven hundred miles of their journey still to be accomplished.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>SERGE DISCOVERS A CURIOUS CAVERN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At the point where our travellers had again struck
the Yukon, nearly fifteen hundred miles from its mouth,
it was still a mighty stream two miles wide. Above
this they found it bounded on both sides by mountains
that often approached to its very waters, where, in
sheer precipices hundreds of feet high, they form
gigantic palisades similar to those of the Hudson,
which are known as the “Upper Ramparts.” On the
lower river the sledge party had journeyed over a
smooth surface, offering but few obstructions. Their
course from Anvik had at first been due north, then
northeast, then east, and was now due south, the
source of the Yukon towards which they were travelling
being some ten degrees south of its great arctic
bend.</p>

<p>Owing to this they now found themselves confronted
by the hardest kind of sledging over rough, hummocky
ice that was often piled in chaotic ridges twenty
and thirty feet high. As the river freezes first at its
most northerly point, and this belt of solid ice is gradually
extended south, or back towards its source, the
floating cakes of its upper reaches, borne by the swift
current, are piled on the ever-advancing barrier in
confused masses that stretch across the river like
windrows.</p>

<p>In the spring, when the ice breaks up and is hurled
irresistibly down stream on the swollen current, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
same effect is reproduced on a vastly increased scale.
Then the upper river breaks first, and a sudden rise of
water from some great tributary starts the ice over the
still solid barrier below. The huge cakes slide, jam,
push, and crash over the still unbroken ice sheet, until
they are piled in a vast gleaming mass seventy or
eighty feet in height, from a quarter of a mile to one
mile in length, and extending from bank to bank.</p>

<p>This mighty gorge must give way at length, and
when it does it goes with a roaring fury that is terrifying
and grand beyond description. After grinding
and tearing onward for several miles, or perhaps
less than one, the furious impulse is again checked by
another solid barrier, which must in turn be broken
down and swept away, its added weight giving increased
energy to the mighty force.</p>

<p>So the ice crashes its resistless way down the whole
Yukon Valley to Bering Sea, two thousand miles distant,
sweeping everything before it, mowing down vast
areas of forest, submerging islands, tearing out banks,
and leaving everywhere traces of its terrible progress
in the shape of huge ice cakes, weighing many tons,
stranded high above ordinary water-level.</p>

<p>Although Phil Ryder and his companions were not
to witness this grand exhibition of one of nature’s
mightiest forces, they were sadly inconvenienced and
delayed by the uncomfortable fashion in which their
frozen highway had been constructed some months
earlier. If they could have left the river and followed
along its banks they would have done so; but this was
out of the question, not only on account of their rugged
character, but because on their timbered portions the
snow lay many feet in depth, while from the river it
had been so blown by strong north winds that for long
stretches the ice was barely covered. This enabled
the sledge men to walk without snow-shoes, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a great comfort to all three, but especially to Jalap
Coombs, who had not yet learned to use the netted
frames with “ease and fluency,” as Phil said.</p>

<p>To this light-hearted youth the sight of his sailor
friend wrestling with the difficulties of inland navigation
as practised in arctic regions afforded a never-failing
source of mirth. A single glance at Jalap’s lank
figure enveloped in furs, with his weather-beaten face
peering from the recesses of a hair-fringed hood, was
enough at any time to make Phil laugh. Jalap on
snow-shoes that, in spite of all his efforts, would slide
in every direction but the one desired, and Jalap gazing
at a frosty world through a pair of wooden snow-goggles,
were sights that even sober-sided Serge found
humorous.</p>

<p>But funniest of all was to see Jalap drive a dog
team. This he was now obliged to do, for, while they
still had three sledges, they had been unable to procure
any Indians at Forty Mile to take the places of Kurilla
and Chitsah. So while Phil, who was now an expert
in the art of dog-driving, and could handle a six-yard
whip like a native, took turns with Serge in breaking
the road, Jalap was always allowed to bring up the
rear. His dogs had nothing to fear from the whip,
except, indeed, when it tripped him up so that he fell
on top of them, but they cringed and whined beneath
the torrent of incomprehensible sea terms incessantly
poured forth by the strange master, who talked to them
as though they were so many lubberly sailors.</p>

<p>“Port your hellum! Hard a-port!” he would roar
to the accompaniment of flying chunks of ice that he
could throw with amazing certainty of aim. Then,
“Steady! So! Start a sheet and give her a rap full.
Now keep her so! Keep her so! D’ye hear? Let
her fall off a fraction of a p’int and I’ll rake ye fore
and aft. Now, then, bullies, pull all together. Yo-ho,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
<em>heave</em>! No sojering! Ah, you will, will ye, ye furry
sea-cook! Then take that, and stow it in your bread-locker.
Shake your hay-seed and climb—<em>climb</em>, I tell
ye! Avast heaving!” And so on, hour after hour,
while the dogs would jump and pull and tangle their
“running-rigging,” as Jalap named the trace-thongs,
and the two boys would shout with laughter.</p>

<p>But while the journey thus furnished something of
merriment, it was also filled with tribulations. So bitter
was the cold that their bloodless lips were often too
stiff for laughter or even for speech. So rough was
the way that they rarely made more than eight or ten
miles in a day of exhausting labor. Several dogs broke
their legs amid the chaotic ice blocks of the ever-recurring
ridges, and had to be shot. Along the palisaded
Ramparts it was difficult to find timbered places
in which to camp. Their dog feed was running low,
and there was none to be had in the wretched native
villages that they passed at long intervals.</p>

<p>At length the setting sun of one evening found them
at a point where the river, narrowed to a few hundred
yards, was bounded on one side by a lofty precipice
of rock, and on the other by a steeply sloping bank
that, devoid of timber, seemed to descend from an
open plateau. They halted beside a single log of drift
that, half embedded in ice, was the only available bit
of firewood in sight. It was a bleak and bitter place
in which to spend an arctic night, and they shivered
in anticipation of what they were to suffer during its
long hours.</p>

<p>“I am going to climb to the top of the bank,” said
Serge, “and see if I can’t find some more wood. If I
do, I’ll roll it down; so look out!”</p>

<p>Suiting his action to his words, the active lad started
with a run that carried him a few yards up the steep
ascent. It was so abrupt that he was on the point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
sliding back, and dug his feet sharply into the snow
to secure a hold. At the same instant he uttered a
cry, threw up his arms, and dropped from the sight
of his astonished companions as though he had fallen
down a well.</p>

<p>Before they could make a move towards his rescue,
they were more astounded than ever to hear his voice,
somewhat muffled, but apparently close beside them.</p>

<p>“I’m all right!” he cried, cheerily. “That is, I think
I am, and I believe I can cut my way out. Don’t try
to climb the bank. Just wait a minute.”</p>

<p>Then the bank began to tremble as though shaken
by a gentle earthquake, and suddenly a hand clutching
a knife shot out from it so close to Jalap Coombs that
the startled sailor leaped back to avoid it, stumbled
over a sledge, and plunged headlong among his own
team of dogs, who were lying in the snow beyond, patiently
waiting to be unharnessed. By the time the
yelling, howling mass of man and dogs was disentangled
and separated, Serge had emerged from the mysterious
bank, and stood looking as though he did not
quite understand what had happened. Behind him
was a black opening into which Phil was peering with
the liveliest curiosity.</p>

<p>“Of all the miracles I ever heard of, this is the
strangest!” he cried. “What does it mean, old
man?”</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly know,” answered Serge. “But I
rather think it is a moss blanket. Anyhow, that’s an
elegant place to crawl into out of the cold. Seems to
be plenty of wood, too.”</p>

<p>Serge was right in his conjecture. What appeared
to be the river-bank was merely a curtain of tough,
closely compacted Alaskan moss, closely resembling
peat in its structure, one foot thick, and reaching from
the crest of an overhanging bank to the edge of the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
It had thus held together, and fallen to its present position
when the river undermined and swept away the
earth from beneath it. That it presented a sloping
surface instead of hanging perpendicularly was owing
to a great number of timbers, the ends of which projected
from the excavated bank behind it. Serge had
broken through the moss curtain, fallen between these
timbers to the beach, and then cut his way out. Now,
as he suggested, what better camping-place could they
ask than the warm, dry, moss-enclosed space from
which he had just emerged?</p>

<p>“I never saw nor heard of anything so particularly
and awfully jolly in all my life,” pronounced Phil,
after the three travellers had entered this unique cavern,
and started a fire by which they were enabled to
see something of its strange interior. “And, I say,
Serge, what a thoughtful scheme it was on your part
to provide a chimney for the fire before you lighted it!
See how the smoke draws up? If it wasn’t for that
hole in the roof I am afraid we should be driven out of
here in short order. But, hello, old man! Whew-w!
what are you throwing bones on the fire for? It reminds
me of your brimstone-and-feather experiment on
Oonimak.”</p>

<p>“Bones!” repeated Serge, in surprise. “Are those
bones? I thought they were dry sticks.”</p>

<p>“I should say they were bones!” cried Phil, snatching
a couple of the offending objects from the fire.
“And, sure as I live, this log I am sitting on is a bone,
too. Why, it’s bigger than I am. It begins to look
as though this place were some sort of a tomb. But
there’s plenty of wood. Let’s throw on some more and
light up.”</p>

<p>“Toughest wood to cut I ever see,” growled Jalap
Coombs, who was hacking away at another half-buried
log. “’Pears to be brittle, though, and splits easy,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
added, dodging a sliver that broke off and flew by his
head.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Phil, picking up the sliver.
“You’ll ruin the axe. That’s another bone you’re
chopping. This place is a regular giants’ cemetery.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>CAMPING ’MID PREHISTORIC BONES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>So strange and uncanny was the place in which our
sledge party thus unexpectedly found themselves that
Phil was for exploring it and attempting to determine
its true character at once; but practical Serge persuaded
him to wait until they had performed their regular
evening duties and eaten supper. “After that,”
he said, “we can explore all night if we choose.”</p>

<p>So Phil turned his attention to the dogs, which he
unharnessed and fed, while Serge prepared supper, and
Jalap Coombs gathered a supply of firewood from the
bleached timber ends projecting from the bank behind
them. He tested each of these before cutting into it
to make certain that it was not a bone, quantities of
which were mingled with the timber.</p>

<p>The firewood that he thus collected exhibited several
puzzling peculiarities. To begin with, it was so very
tough and thoroughly lifeless that, as Jalap Coombs
remarked, he didn’t know but what bones would cut
just as easy. When laid on the fire it was slow to ignite,
and finally only smouldered, giving out little light,
but yielding a great heat. As Serge said, it made one
of the poorest fires to see by and one of the best to
cook over that he had ever known.</p>

<p>Although in all their experience they had never enjoyed
a more comfortable and thoroughly protected
camping-place than this one, the lack of their usual
cheerful blaze and their mysterious surroundings created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a feeling of depression that caused them to eat
supper in unusual silence. At its conclusion Serge
picked up a freshly cut bit of the wood, and, holding
it in as good a light as he could get, examined it
closely.</p>

<p>“I never saw nor heard of any wood like this in all
Alaska,” he said at length. “Do you suppose this can
be part of a buried forest that grew perhaps thousands
of years ago?”</p>

<p>“I believe that’s exactly what it is,” replied Phil.
“I expect it was some awfully prehistoric forest that
was blown down by a prehistoric cyclone, and got covered
with mud somehow, and was just beginning to
turn into coal when the ice age set in. Thus it has
been preserved in cold storage ever since. It must
have grown in one of the ages that one always likes
to hear of, but hates to study about—a palæozoic or
silurian or post-tertiary, or one of those times. At
any rate, I expect it was a tropical forest, for they all
were in those days.”</p>

<p>“Then like as not these here is elephants’ bones,” remarked
Jalap Coombs. “I were jest thinking as how
this one had a look of ivory about it.”</p>

<p>“They may be,” assented Phil, dubiously, “but
they must have belonged to pretty huge old elephants;
for I don’t believe Jumbo’s bones would look like more
than toothpicks alongside some of these. It is more
likely that they belonged to hairy mammoths, or mastodons,
or megatheriums, or plessiosauruses, or fellows
like that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I ever met up with any of them,
nor yet heerd tell of ’em,” replied Jalap Coombs, simply,
“onless what you’ve jest said is the Latin names
of rhinocerosses or hoponthomases or giraffles, of which
my old friend Kite Roberson useter speak quite frequent.
He allus said consarning ’em, though, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
they’d best be let alone, for lions nor yet taggers
warn’t a sarcumstance to ’em. Now ef these here bones
belonged to any sich critters as them, he sartainly
knowed what he were talking about, and I for one
are well pleased that they all went dead afore we hove
in sight.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but what I am too,” assented Phil,
“for at close range I expect it would be safer to meet
one of Mr. Robinson’s taggers. Still, I would like to
have seen them from a safe place, like the top of Groton
Monument or behind the bars of a bank vault.
Where are you going, Serge?”</p>

<p>“Going for some wood that isn’t quite so prehistoric
and that will blaze,” answered the other lad, who had
picked up an axe and was stepping towards the entrance
to the cavern.</p>

<p>“That’s a scheme! Come on, Mr. Coombs. Let’s
help him tackle that up-to-date log outside, and see if
we can’t get a modern illumination out of it,” suggested
Phil.</p>

<p>So they chopped vigorously at the ice-bound drift-log
that had induced them to halt at that point, and
half an hour later the gloom of their cavern was dispelled
by a roaring, snapping, up-to-date blaze. By
its cheerful light they examined with intense interest
the great fossil bones that, in various stages of preservation,
lay scattered about them.</p>

<p>“I should think a whole herd of mammoths must
have perished at once,” said Phil. “Probably they were
being hunted by some antediluvian Siwash and got
bogged in a quicksand. How I wish we could see a
whole one! But, great Scott! now we have gone and
done it!”</p>

<p>Phil’s final exclamation was caused by a crackling
sound overhead. The sloping moss roof had caught
fire from the leaping blaze, and for a moment the dismayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
spectators of this catastrophe imagined that
their snug camping-place was about to be destroyed.
They quickly saw, however, that the body of the moss
was not burning; it was too thoroughly permeated
with ice for that, and that the fire was only flashing
over its dry under surface.</p>

<p>As they watched these fitful flames running along
the roof and illuminating remote recesses of the cavern,
all three suddenly uttered cries of amazement, and
each called the attention of the others to the most
wonderful sight he had ever seen. Brilliantly lighted
and distinctly outlined against the dark background of
a clay bank, that held it intact, was a gigantic skeleton
complete in every detail, even to a huge tusk that
curved outward from a massive skull. <a href="#i_fp174">For a single
minute they gazed in breathless awe.</a> Then the illuminating
flame died out, and like a dissolving picture
the vast outline slowly faded from view and was lost
in the blackness.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_174">FOR A SINGLE MINUTE THEY GAZED IN BREATHLESS AWE</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Was that one of ’em?” gasped Jalap Coombs.</p>

<p>“I expect it was,” answered Phil.</p>

<p>“Waal, then, old Kite didn’t make no mistake when
he said a tagger warn’t a sarcumstance.”</p>

<p>“It must have been all of twenty feet high,” remarked
Serge, reflectively.</p>

<p>For more than an hour they talked of the wonderful
sight, and Phil told what he could remember of the gigantic
hairy mammoth discovered frozen in a Siberian
glacier, and so perfectly preserved that sledge-dogs
were fed for weeks on its flesh.</p>

<p>As they talked their fire burned low, and the outside
cold creeping stealthily into camp turned their
thoughts to fur-lined sleeping-bags. So they slept,
and dreamed of prehistoric monsters; while Musky,
Luvtuk, Amook, and their comrades restlessly sniffed
and gnawed at the ancient bones of this strange encampment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and wondered at finding them so void of
flavor.</p>

<p>Glad as our sledge travellers would have been to
linger for days and fully explore the mysteries of that
great moss-hidden cavern, they dared not take the necessary
time. It was already two weeks since they had
left the mining camp, winter was waning, and they must
leave the river ere spring destroyed its icy highway.
So they were off again with the first gray light of
morning, and two days later found them at the mouth
of the Pelly River, the upper Yukon’s largest tributary,
and two hundred and fifteen miles from Forty
Mile.</p>

<p>The last half of this distance had been traversed
amid scenes of the same stupendous grandeur that attracts
thousands of tourists to the Yosemite and Yellowstone.
But our travellers only shuddered at its
wind-swept silence and terrible loneliness. The latter
was increased by the melancholy ruins of old Fort
Selkirk, whose three gaunt chimneys still stand, about
one mile below the mouth of the Pelly, on the opposite
side of the Yukon. That evening in the snug quarters
of Harper, the Pelly River trader, who was the
last white man they could hope to meet before reaching
the coast, they listened to the story of Fort Selkirk.</p>

<p>It was established in 1850 by the Hudson Bay Company,
and was their remotest post. So far removed
was it from the base of supplies that goods destined
for it were two full years in making the journey from
London by ship and across the great northern wilderness
by river and portage. Previous to that time the
Indian trade of the Yukon valley had been monopolized
by the Chilkats, wealthiest, most enterprising, and most
warlike of Alaskan natives. Securing goods from the
Russians at Sitka, they would carry them to their distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
villages in canoes, and transport them across the
mountains to Yukon head-waters on their backs. There
they would be met by the interior Indians, whom they
never allowed to visit the coast.</p>

<p>The Chilkats were shrewd enough to reap enormous
profits from this trade, and to fully appreciate its value.
As soon, therefore, as they learned of the establishment
of Fort Selkirk, and realized that it meant the
overthrow of their lucrative business, they resorted to
the only method of trade competition of which they
had any knowledge. They organized a war party,
crossed the mountains, descended the Yukon nearly
five hundred miles, and wiped Fort Selkirk out of existence,
seizing its goods in payment for their trouble.</p>

<p>From the Pelly River trader our travellers gained
much valuable information concerning the routes they
might pursue and the difficulties they had yet to encounter.
They had indeed heard vaguely of the great
cañon of the Yukon, through which the mad waters
are poured with such fury that they can never freeze,
of the rocky Five Fingers that obstruct its channel,
the Rink and White Horse rapids, and the turbulent
open streams connecting its upper chain of lakes; but
until this time they had given these dangers little
thought. Now they became real, while some of them,
according to the trader, were impassable save by weary
détours through dense forests and deep snows that
they feared would delay them beyond the time of the
river’s breaking up.</p>

<p>“What, then, can we do?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” replied the trader. “Leave the Yukon
at this point, go about fifty miles up the Pelly, and turn
to your right into the Fox. Ascend this to its head,
cross Fox Lake, Indian Trail Lake, Lost Lake, and three
other small lakes. Then go down a creek that empties
into the Little Salmon, and a few miles down that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
river to the Yukon. In this way you will have avoided
the Five Fingers and the Rink Rapids, and found good
ice all the way. After that keep on up the main river
till you pass Lake Le Barge. There again leave the
Yukon, this time for good, by the first stream that flows
in on your right. It is the Tahkeena, and will lead
you to the Chilkat Pass, which is somewhat longer,
but no worse than the Chilkoot. Thus you will avoid
most of the rough ice, the great cañon, and all the
rapids.”</p>

<p>“But we shall surely get lost,” objected Phil.</p>

<p>“Not if you can hire Cree Jim, who lives somewhere
up on the Fox River, to go with you, for he is the best
guide in the country.”</p>

<p>So the next morning Phil and his companions again
set forth, this time up the Pelly River, with all their
hopes for safety and a successful termination to their
journey centred upon the finding and hiring of Cree
Jim, the guide.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>LOST IN THE FOREST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was not difficult to find the Fox River, for it was
the first stream flowing into the Pelly on the right,
and as the ice in the latter river was much smoother
than it had been on the Yukon, our sledge travellers
turned into it on the second day after leaving Harper’s.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Phil, “we must keep a sharp lookout
for Cree Jim’s cabin; for as no one seems to know
exactly where it is located, we may find it anywhere
between here and the head of the stream. At any rate,
we can’t afford to miss it.”</p>

<p>They did miss it though, and, after camping one
night on the river, reached its head in a lake that they
knew must be the Fox. Although the day was but
half spent, Phil decided to camp at that point.</p>

<p>“You and I, Serge,” he said, “must go back down
the river, one on each side, making long détours away
from it, in hopes of finding either the cabin or some
trail leading to it. At the same time we must keep a
sharp lookout for game. Anything from a bear to a
rabbit would be acceptable now, for if we don’t replenish
our stock of meat pretty soon we shall lose
our dogs.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Serge; “only, Phil, do be careful
and not get lost.”</p>

<p>“Never you fear on that score,” laughed the young
leader; “I’ll look out for myself, but see that you do
the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>So the two lads set forth, leaving Jalap Coombs to
prepare camp and boil the oatmeal porridge, which,
mixed with a small quantity of fish, now formed the
dogs’ daily meal.</p>

<p>Phil plunged directly into the forest, deciding to
start out with one of the détours that he had planned.
Once within shelter of the trees, he found the snow so
deep that but for his snow-shoes he could have made
no progress. By their aid he was able to push forward
at a fair rate of speed, which he determined to
maintain on as straight a line as possible until within
half an hour of sunset. Then he would bend to the
left until he reached the river, which he was certain
could not be very far away, and which he could follow
back to camp even in the dark.</p>

<p>So for several hours he plodded sturdily forward,
keeping a sharp lookout for any trail of man or beast,
and making as little noise as possible, in the hope of
surprising something worthy of a shot. All at once
the surprise came from the other side; for, with a
rush from behind a clump of young hemlocks, a huge
brown animal, with great palmated horns, crossed his
path only a few rods ahead, and dashed away at right
angles, flinging the snow to both sides like a rotary
railroad plough. Rapid as were his movements, Phil
got in one flying shot just as he disappeared.</p>

<p>“It was a moose!” thought the excited lad; “biggest
one I ever saw. And I hit him!” he cried aloud,
a minute later, as he examined the broad trail left by
the flying beast. “Hit him hard, too!” he added, as,
noting blood-stains on the snow, and forgetful of
everything else, he set forth in hot pursuit of his
stricken game. “He can’t hold that pace long, wounded,
and through snow as deep as this,” he reflected,
“and I shouldn’t be surprised if I found him at
bay inside of a mile. Oh, if I can only get him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
it will settle the food question for the rest of the
trip!”</p>

<p>So, with high hopes, and with all his hunting instincts
fully aroused, Phil followed that blood-stained
trail, not only for one mile, but for several more,
though without catching another glimpse of the flying
moose. Nor could he discover any sign of slackened
speed or diminished strength on the part of his
huge quarry. The strides were just as long as at first,
and the snow was flung just as far on either side of
the trail. But for the crimson stains betokening a
steady loss of blood, Phil would long since have given
up the chase. They encouraged him to keep on, “For
surely,” he said to himself, “no animal, not even a
moose, can stand a drain like that forever.”</p>

<p>All at once he stopped short, and gazed about him
with startled glances. The trail was growing dim;
stealthy shadows were creeping through the forest.
The day was spent and night was at hand. “Now I
<em>am</em> in for it!” he cried, bitterly. “Here I am miles
from camp without an idea of its direction or that of
the river. My only guide to either is the trail by which
I have just come, and I should lose that in the darkness
before I had gone half a mile. The only thing
to do is to make a hungry camp, and make it quick,
too, before the light is wholly gone.”</p>

<p>Thus deciding, Phil left the trail and hastened towards
a bunch of dead timber that stood a short distance
to one side. He scraped the snow from a prostrate
log, and then, using one of his snow-shoes as a
shovel, dug out a small space down to the ground beside
it. A little pile of dry twigs and bark, and a few
sticks of larger wood, were hastily collected and heaped
against the log. When he got his fire well started he
would gather more. Now to whittle a handful of
shavings, and then for a blaze. Oh, how good it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
would seem! How it would drive away the horrid
loneliness, push back the encroaching shadows, and
replace the deadly chill of the on-coming night with
its own genial warmth! It could not furnish food, of
course, and he must endure long hours of hunger, but
even that could be borne with its cheery aid.</p>

<p>And now to light it. Phil had a match-safe in one
of his inner pockets, where he always carried it for just
such emergencies as this, and at length, after a struggle
with his close-fitting parka, he drew it forth. As he
opened it, and gazed into its empty interior, a chill
penetrated his very marrow.</p>

<p>“What a fool I am! what a miserable, careless fool!”
he cried, in tones of despair. “I knew it was empty
two days ago, and meant to refill it; but I didn’t, and
now I must suffer the consequences. What shall I do?
what shall I do? A night in this place without a fire
will drive me crazy, even if I don’t freeze to death
before morning.”</p>

<p>As Phil gazed about him in a very agony of apprehension,
his glance rested on his rifle leaning against
a tree, and a ray of hope entered his heart. There
was fire if he could only capture and control it. How
was it that wrecked sailors, and lost hunters, and all
sorts of people always managed to obtain fire from a
gun, or rather from a pistol, which was practically the
same thing? He tried to recall what he had read of
such experiences. Oh yes! It was by flashing powder
in the pan. But his gun hadn’t any pan. He had
never seen one that had, unless it was Kurilla’s flintlock.
Of course, now he remembered, it did have a place
into which the Indian used to pour a little powder
every time he wanted to fire his old blunderbuss. How
Phil wished his Winchester were a flintlock musket
just at that moment! But it wasn’t, and it didn’t have
any pan, and loose powder was not used in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
with it. But there was plenty of powder incased in
its metallic cartridges if only he could get at it, and
could contrive some plan for adapting it to his purpose.</p>

<p>All these ideas passed like a flash, and Phil had
hardly thought of powder before he was examining
one of his cartridges, and trying to dig the bullet out
of its metal shell with the point of his knife. But it
was held too tightly, and he only pricked his fingers.</p>

<p>Then another plan came into his mind. He laid
his rifle on the ground; over its stock he spread a
square of cotton cloth such as he and Serge were accustomed
to tear from the great piece provided among
their stores whenever they needed clean handkerchiefs.
On the cloth Phil laid a cartridge, that he held in position
with the sharp edge of his knife-blade, placed
so that it would cut just at the base of the bullet.
Then he struck the back of the blade a smart blow
with a billet of wood, and the job was done. He had
got at the powder.</p>

<p>He poured out two-thirds of the precious mixture,
and rubbed it well into one side of the cloth, which he
doubled twice and fixed against the log. Then, after
stopping the open end of the shell with a tiny wad of
lint to keep the remainder of the powder from running
out, he inserted it in the chamber of his rifle. Aiming
it at the cloth, with the muzzle about one foot away,
and trembling with cold, or excitement, or anxiety, or
with all three, he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The report that followed was hardly as loud as that
of a small fire-cracker, but the success of the scheme
was instant. The little flame poured from the muzzle
of the rifle into that powder-impregnated square of
cotton cloth ignited it at once. A moment later it was
nestled amid the bundle of twigs and shavings, while
Phil, on hands and knees, was puffing at it like a pair
of bellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>In two minutes more his fire was a certainty, the
black shadows were already beginning to retreat before
its cheery attack, and Phil Ryder’s spirits had
jumped from zero almost to the figure that represents
light-heartedness.</p>

<p>Throwing off his fur parka, that he might the better
appreciate its warmth later, and seizing a snow-shoe,
he cleared the whole space between the first log and
another that lay a few yards beyond. Into this opening
he dragged all the logs and dead branches he could
find, working with such energy that at the end of an
hour he had a fine large pile, and was in a glow from
the exercise. Now he built another fire against the
farther log, and piled his spare wood so that it was
beyond reach of either flame.</p>

<p>He next spread a few spruce and hemlock boughs on
the ground between the two fires, selected a medium-sized
chunk of wood for a pillow, donned his parka,
drew its great hood over his head, and, with his rifle
by his side, lay down on a much warmer and more
comfortable couch than he had dared anticipate a
couple of hours before.</p>

<p>Phil meant to keep awake so as to tend his fires, but
instead of so doing he fell asleep within an hour, and
slept soundly right through the night. When he at
length awoke and sat up, he was chilled and stiff with
cold, for the fires were very nearly extinguished by a
fall of snow that had sifted down through the forest
while he slept. As the poor lad discovered this he became
filled with terror, for he knew that the back trail
was obliterated, and that all hope of regaining camp by
its means was cut off. Now he was indeed lost. As he
gazed hopeless and bewildered about him he caught sight
of something that he at first took to be a dog sitting
only a few yards away, and regarding him hungrily.
He spoke to it, and the animal started to sneak away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Then he saw that it was a wolf, and he hastened its
movements with a rifle-shot.</p>

<p>As it was not yet light enough to commence his
search for the river, or for some stream that would
lead him to it, he began to throw wood on the fires, that
he might at least get warm before starting. While
thus engaged he was startled by a cry apparently in
the voice of a child that rang dolefully through the
silent forest. Again he heard it, plaintive and long-drawn,
and this time nearer than before. It was so
weird a cry to be heard in that place and at that time
that he shuddered as he listened for its repetition. Its
very humanness added to its terror. At its third utterance
Phil seized his rifle, cocked it, and faced the direction
of the sound, expecting in another moment to
be confronted by the tawny form of a mountain-lion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>PHIL ASSUMES A RESPONSIBILITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Phil had never met nor even seen a mountain-lion,
but he had often heard that its cry sometimes imitates
that of a child so closely as to deceive the most expert
of hunters. He had heard, too, of its ferocity, its boldness
in attacking human beings, and its terrible strength.
In some respects it is even more to be feared than that
monarch of the North American wilderness the grizzly
bear, for the former, belonging to the cat family, is a
famous tree-climber, which the latter is not.</p>

<p>These thoughts, together with all the stories he had
ever read of mountain-lions, flashed through the lad’s
mind in the few minutes that elapsed between the first
and third of those terrible cries. Before it could utter
another the fearful beast would be upon him, and with
tense muscles he braced himself for the coming conflict.
He would not have a chance for more than one
shot. If it failed him, all would be lost.</p>

<p>The sound of the third wailing cry had hardly died
away when, with a gasp half of relief that the suspense
was ended, half of dread, Phil caught a momentary
glimpse of a brown furry object moving through
the trees. It would next appear from behind yonder
clump of bushes. The rifle was slowly lifted, a deliberate
sight was taken along its shining barrel, and then,
as the furry object appeared at the precise point where
it was expected, the forest echoed with its ringing shot.
But the bullet had not been allowed to fulfil its fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
mission. One blessed instant had been granted, even
as the trigger was pressed, in which to give the barrel
a slight upward jerk, and deflect the leaden messenger
from its deadly course.</p>

<p>The rifle fell from Phil’s nerveless hand, as weak
and faint he leaned against a friendly tree trunk. As
he stood there, staring with still unbelieving eyes, a
little fur-clad child, not more than four years old,
walking on the tiniest of snow-shoes, came close to
him, smiled trustfully up in his face, and, holding out
a small mittened hand, said:</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp186">“Come, man. Come wif Nel-te. Mamma say come.”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">
<a id="i_fp186">
  <img src="images/i_fp186.jpg" width="590" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_186">“COME, MAN. COME WIF NEL-TE. MAMMA SAY COME”</a></div>
</div>

<p>If Phil had been nearly paralyzed with horror to discover,
as his eye glanced along the levelled rifle-barrel,
that he was aiming at a human being, he was almost
equally staggered at hearing the fur-clad atom who
called himself Nel-te address him in English. How
could it be? Who was he? How came he there,
alone in that vast wilderness of trackless forest, ice,
and snow? Where had the child spent the night just
passed, that had been so filled with terrors to him?
How had he lived through it? Where <em>was</em> his
mother?</p>

<p>All these questions and more he asked the child as
he sat on a log, and, drawing the little one to him,
gazed at him as though he were unreal, and might at
any moment vanish as mysteriously as he had come.</p>

<p>But the child evidently had neither the time nor the
inclination for explanations. He gravely repelled all
the lad’s friendly advances, and turned to go away, as
though confidently expecting him to follow. As Phil
hesitated for a moment he looked back, and in a voice
that had a slight tremble, together with a lower lip
that quivered just a little, he repeated:</p>

<p>“Come. Mamma say come.”</p>

<p>And Phil, picking up his rifle, followed after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
unique little figure like one who is dazed. A happy smile
lighted the child’s face at this compliance with his
wish, and after that he plodded sturdily onward without
turning his head, as though satisfied that his mission
was accomplished. After thus going something
less than a quarter of a mile, they emerged from the
forest, and came to a log-cabin standing on the bank
of a small stream.</p>

<p>Though fairly well built, this cabin did not differ in
outward appearance from ordinary structures of its
kind in that country, save that its single glass window
was hung with white curtains. These caught Phil’s
eye at once, but ere he had time to speculate concerning
them his little guide had reached the door. Slipping
off the small snow-shoes, he pushed it open and
entered. Phil followed, but had not taken a single
step into the interior ere he started back in dismay.</p>

<p>On the floor close beside the threshold lay an Indian—a
tall, handsome fellow, but with a terrible gash in
his side. From it his life’s blood had evidently drained
some time before, for it needed but a glance to show
that he was dead.</p>

<p>From this startling sight the lad’s gaze wandered
across the room. It caught the white curtains, a few
poor attempts at ornamentation of the walls, an empty
hearth, on which was no spark of fire, and then rested
on a rude bed in one corner, to which the child had just
run with a joyful cry.</p>

<p>On the bed lay a woman, and, to Phil’s utter amazement,
she was a white woman, who was feebly speaking
to him in English. Her bloodless face, terribly
emaciated, was surrounded by a wealth of dark-brown
hair, and her great eyes were fixed on him with a pitiful
eagerness.</p>

<p>“Thank God! thank God, sir!” she said, in a voice
so near a whisper that Phil was obliged to bend his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
head to catch the words. “Now that you’ve come, I
can die in peace, for my Nel-te will be cared for. I
prayed, oh, how I prayed! But it seemed as if my
prayers were to be of no avail, until at length the answer
came in the report of your gun. Then I sent the
child to find you. And oh, sir, I do thank you for
coming! I do thank my Heavenly Father for sending
you. And you will care for my baby? You will take
him far from here, where he may grow to be a good
and useful man? You will, won’t you, sir? Promise
me! Promise me you will.”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t die,” answered poor Phil, who
was so bewildered by the perplexities of the situation
that he knew not what to say. “I have two companions
who will know what to do for you, and we will
stay until you get stronger. What does it all mean,
anyway? Are you wounded? Did that Indian attack
you?”</p>

<p>“He was my husband, my Jim,” answered the woman,
again opening her eyes, which had closed wearily
after her recent effort at talking. “He died for me,
and I am dying for him.”</p>

<p>Here she was interrupted by a terrible fit of coughing
and a gush of blood from some internal hemorrhage.</p>

<p>After a few minutes she continued: “He shot a
moose, and with its last strength it charged on him.
When he did not come home I went in search of
him. I found them lying together. Jim still breathed.
Somehow I managed to bring him home on my back.
But he was dead when I got him here, and the strain
had been too great for me. I had burst a blood-vessel,
and had barely strength to crawl to the bed. That
was two days ago. I should have died that first night,
but fought with death for Nel-te’s sake. Now I can
go, and I am glad, for I am so weary—so weary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>This pitiful story was told in whispers, with many
pauses and many struggles for breath. When it was
finished the great pleading eyes again closed, and the
woman lay so still that Phil thought she must be dead.
He tried to feel of her pulse, but started at the touch
of her hand, for it was like ice. The chill of it seemed
to reach his very heart, and he shivered in the deadly
cold of the room.</p>

<p>“I can at least make a fire,” he thought, and he began
to search for matches. There were none, and finally
bethinking himself of the blaze he had left in the
woods, he set forth to fetch fire from it. In a few
minutes he returned with a couple of burning brands.
Then he brought in wood, and after a little the great
fireplace was filled with leaping flames.</p>

<p>Nel-te came to him and begged for water. Phil had
noticed several times that the child was eating snow,
and now berated himself for not realizing that the little
fellow was thirsty. He melted snow in a kettle,
and the boy drank eagerly. Then from some hiding-place
he produced a smoked salmon, that he began to eat
ravenously. After a little he paused, looked hesitatingly
at Phil, and then shyly, but with inborn hospitality,
held out the fish to his guest, saying, “You hungry?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I am, little chap,” answered Phil, who was
just remembering how very hungry he was, “and I
shall be only too glad to take a bite with you.” So
he cut off a piece of the fish, and as the two ate their
strange meal in company Phil knew that the little
stranger had won his heart; for never had he felt so
drawn to any child as to this one.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged the woman again
unclosed her eyes, and made a slight movement. Phil
held a cup of water to her lips, and she drank thirstily.
It seemed to give her strength, for she said, and
this time in clearer tones than before:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have not promised me, lad. But you will—I
know you will; for God has sent you in answer to my
prayers. You will care for my baby, and try to love
him, and never let him forget his mother. You will
promise, and I know I can trust you, for you have a
brave face and honest. You will promise me?”</p>

<p>“I do promise,” said Phil, solemnly, “that if you
are taken from your boy I will care for him to the best
of my ability, and be to him a brother and—”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, lad. Now hand him to me, for I
canna see him. His name is Nelson McLeod.”</p>

<p>This last came in so faint a whisper that Phil barely
caught the words; but as he lifted the little one to
the bed the woman seemed to gain a new strength,
for she flung her arms about the child, strained him
to her breast, and kissed him.</p>

<p>Then the wasted arms unclosed. She fell back, a
smile glorified her face, and the great brown eyes
opened for one parting look at her boy. In another
moment, with a sigh of content, she fell into the sleep
that knows no waking; and Phil, recalling the long-ago
story of the missionary, knew that the sorrows of
Ellen McLeod were ended.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>A WILDERNESS ORPHAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The position in which Phil now found himself was
certainly a perplexing one. By the very simple process
of getting lost he had discovered Cree Jim’s cabin, but
was appalled to consider what else he had found at the
same time. He now knew that the remainder of their
journey, its most difficult and dangerous portion, must
be undertaken without a guide. Not only this, but
they must be burdened with a child so young as to be
practically helpless. In the meantime, what was to be
done with those silent and motionless forms whose
dread presence so pervaded that lonely cabin? And
how was he to communicate with his friends? There
was no back trail to follow, for the snow had wiped it
out. He did not even know in which direction camp
lay, for, in the ardor of his chase the evening before,
he had taken no note of course nor distance.</p>

<p>There was the stream, though, on whose bank the
cabin was perched. It must flow into the river. Yes,
that was his only hope. But the river might be miles
away, and the camp as much farther off; if, indeed,
it could still be found where he had left it. But of
course it would be! So long as Serge Belcofsky and
Jalap Coombs had life and strength to search for him
that camp would remain a permanent fixture until he
returned to it. Phil was absolutely sure of that, and
he now realized, as never before, the priceless value
of a friendship whose loyalty is beyond doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>So the plan was formed. He would go down the
stream and up the river until he found camp. Then
he would bring Serge and a sledge back with him. In
the meantime the child must be left where he was,
for Phil doubted if he could carry him over the weary
miles that he knew must lie between the cabin and
camp, while for the little fellow to walk that distance
was out of the question.</p>

<p>Phil sat on a stool before the fire while doing all
this thinking. As he rose to carry out his plan, Nel-te,
who was becoming terrified at his mother’s silence in
spite of his efforts to attract her attention, slipped from
the bed, ran to his new friend, and thrusting a cold
little hand into one of his, looked up with a smile of
such perfect trust that Phil snatched him in his arms
and kissed him, at the same time giving him a great
hug.</p>

<p>Then he said: “Now, Nel-te, Brother Phil is going
away for a little while to get some doggies for you to
play with, and you must stay here like a good boy,
and not open the door until he comes back. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes; me go get doggies. Nel-te like doggies.
Good doggies!” And almost before Phil knew what
the child was about, he had slipped from his arms, run
to the door, and was putting on the tiny snow-shoes
that had been left outside. Then, with an engaging
smile, he called, cheerily, “Come. Nel-te say come.
Get doggies.”</p>

<p>“All right, little chap. I expect your plan is as
good as mine, after all,” replied Phil, into whose mind
had just flashed the promise made to that dead mother—never
to desert her baby. “And here I was about
to begin by doing that very thing,” he reflected as he
glanced at the marble face overspread by the expression
of perfect content that his promise had brought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Moved by a sudden impulse he picked up the boy,
and, bringing him back, held him so that he might
kiss the peaceful face. This the child did with a soft
cooing that served to convey both love and pity. Then
he ran to the stalwart figure that still lay on the floor,
and, patting its swarthy cheek, said something in the
Cree tongue that Phil did not understand.</p>

<p>After that Phil carefully closed the door to prevent
the intrusion of wild beasts, and the two, whose fortunes
had become so strangely interwoven, set forth together
down the white surface of the forest-bordered
stream, on whose bank Nel-te had been born and passed
his few years of life. He was happily but unconsciously
venturing on his first “little journey into the
world,” while his companion was filled with a sense
of manliness and responsibility from the experiences
through which he had just passed that the mere adding
of years could never have brought.</p>

<p>Phil wondered at the ease with which the little fellow
managed his snow-shoes, until he reflected that
the child had probably been taught to use them from
the day of taking his first step. So the two fur-clad
figures, ridiculously contrasted in size, trudged along
side by side down the winding stream, the one thoughtfully
silent and the other chattering of “doggies” until
he began to lag behind and give signs that the pace
was telling on his slender strength.</p>

<p>“Poor little chap!” said Phil. “But I have been
expecting it, and now we will try another scheme.”
So, slinging the tiny snow-shoes across the child’s back,
he picked him up and set him astride his own broad
shoulders, where Nel-te clutched his head, and shouted
with glee at this delightful mode of travel.</p>

<p>After they had gone a mile or so in this fashion
they rounded a sharp bend, and came so suddenly
upon poor Serge, who was making his way up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
stream in search of some trace of his friend, that for a
moment he stood motionless and speechless with amazement.
He could make nothing of the approaching apparition
until Phil shouted, cheerily:</p>

<p>“Hurrah, old man! Here we are, safe and sound,
and awfully glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Phil!” cried Serge, while tears actually stood
in his honest blue eyes, “I can hardly believe it! It
seems almost too good to be true. Are you sure you
are not wounded nor frozen nor hurt in any way?
Haven’t you suffered terribly? If you haven’t, we
have. I don’t believe Mr. Coombs slept a wink last
night, and I know I didn’t. But I am happy enough
at this minute to make up for it all, a hundred times
over. Oh, Phil!”</p>

<p>“I have suffered a little from anxiety, and been a
trifle hungry, and had some sad experiences, but I
haven’t suffered half so much as I deserved for my
carelessness in getting lost. I found Cree Jim, though;
but—”</p>

<p>“And brought him with you?” interrupted Serge,
smiling for the first time in many hours, as he glanced
at the quaint little figure perched on Phil’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied the other, soberly. “You
see this little chap is his son, and I’ve adopted him for
a sort of a brother, and he is going with us.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done what?” cried Serge.</p>

<p>“Adopted him. That is, you see I promised my
aunt Ruth to bring her something from Alaska that
was unique in the way of a curio, and it seems to me
that Nel-te here will please her about as well as anything.
Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” assented Serge, doubtfully. “But
was his father willing that you should have him?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, perfectly. That is, you know, he is dead,
and so is the mother; but I promised her to take care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of the little chap, and as there wasn’t anything else to
be done, why, here we are.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s all right if you say so,” agreed
Serge, “and I don’t care, so long as you are safe, if
you carry a whole tribe back to your aunt Ruth; but
now don’t you think we’d better be getting along to
camp? It was all I could do to persuade Mr. Coombs
to stay behind and look out for things; he is so anxious.
The only way I could induce him to stay was by suggesting
that you might come in tired and hungry,
and would feel awfully if no one was there to welcome
you. But he is liable to set out on a hunt for you at
any moment.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, we must get there as quickly as possible,”
replied Phil. “How far is it?”</p>

<p>“Not more than one mile up the river from the
mouth of this creek, which is only a few rods below
here. But oh, Phil, to think that I have found you!
When I had almost given up all hope of ever again
seeing you alive, too. I have been down as far as our
first camp on the river this morning, and this creek
was my last hope. I wouldn’t have left the country
without you, though, or at any rate without knowing
what had become of you. Neither would Mr. Coombs.
We settled that last night while we talked over what
had best be done.”</p>

<p>“I was sure you wouldn’t, old fellow,” replied Phil,
with something like a choke in his voice. “I knew
that as well before you said it as I do now, and it was
the thing that kept me up most of all.”</p>

<p>The two boys had so much to tell, and so many
proofs of loving confidence to exchange, that, before
they realized they were anywhere near camp they came
upon it, and were hailed by Jalap Coombs, who almost
hugged Phil in his revulsion of feeling and unaffected
joy at the lad’s return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you don’t do it again, Philip, my son!” he
cried. “That is, the next time you feel inclined to
wander from home and stay out nights, you may go, of
course, but you’ll have to take me along. So ef you
gits lost, I gits lost likewise; for, as my old friend
Kite Roberson useter say consarning prodegal sons,
‘It’s allus toughest on them as is left behind.’ But,
Phil, what be ye doing with that furry little beggar?
Is he the pilot ye went sarching for?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Phil, lifting Nel-te down from his
shoulders. “He is the pilot who is to lead us from
this wilderness, and if you have got anything to eat,
you’d better give it to him before he devours one of
the dogs, which he seems inclined to do. I can answer
for it that he has been on short rations for several
days and is properly hungry.”</p>

<p>“Have I got anything to eat?” cried the other.
“Waal, rather! How does fresh steaks, and roasts,
and chops, and stews strike your fancy?” With this
he pointed to one side of the camp, where, to their astonishment,
the boys saw a quantity of fresh meat,
much of which was already cut into thin strips for
freezing and packing.</p>

<p>“Where did it come from?” queried Phil, looking
at Serge; but the latter only shook his head, evidently
equally puzzled.</p>

<p>“It’s jest a bit of salvage that I raked in as it went
drifting by,” explained Jalap Coombs, his face beaming
with gratified pride. “It’s some kind of deer meat,
and <em>for</em> a deer he were pretty nigh as big as one of
them elephants back yonder in the moss cave. You
see, he came cruising along this way shortly after Serge
left, and the dogs give chase and made him heave to.
When I j’ined ’em he surrendered. Then I had my
hands full in a hurry, driving off the dogs and lashing
’em fast so as they couldn’t eat him, horns and all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
cutting of him up. I hain’t more’n made a beginning
with him either, for there’s pretty nigh a full cargo
left.”</p>

<p>“But how did you kill him? There wasn’t any gun
in camp?” asked Phil, utterly bewildered.</p>

<p>“Of course there warn’t no gun,” answered Jalap
Coombs, “and likewise I didn’t need one. Sich things
I leave for boys. How did I kill him, say you?
Why, I jest naterally harpooned him like I would any
other whale.”</p>

<small>JALAP AND THE DOGS SING A LULLABY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Harpooned a moose!” cried Phil and Serge together;
for they had by this time discovered the nature
of the sailor’s “big deer.” And “Where did you
get the harpoon?” asked the former.</p>

<p>“Found it leaning agin a tree while I were out after
firewood,” replied Jalap Coombs, at the same time producing
and proudly exhibiting a heavy A-yan spear,
such as were formerly used by the natives of the Pelly
river valley. “It were a trifle rusty, and a trifle light in
the butt,” he added, “but it come in mighty handy when
it were most needed, and for an old whaler it aren’t
a bad sort of a weepon. I’m free to say, though, that
I might have had hard luck in tackling the beast with
it ef he hadn’t been already wounded. I didn’t know it
till after he were dead; but when I come to cut him up,
I saw where he’d been bleeding pretty free, and then
I found this bullet in his innards. Still, I don’t reckin
you’d have called him a mouse, nor yet a rat, if ye’d
seed him like I did under full sail, with his horns set
wing and wing, showing the spread of a fifty-ton
schooner. Ef I hadn’t had the harpoon I’d left him
severely alone; but I allowed that a weepon as were
good enough for a whale would do for a deer, even ef
he were bigger than the run.”</p>

<p>“It’s a rifle-bullet, calibre forty-four,” said Phil, who
was examining the bit of lead that Jalap Coombs had
taken from his “big deer.” “I wonder if it can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
possible that he is the same moose I wounded, and
without whose lead I should never have found Cree
Jim’s cabin. It seems incredible that he should have
come right back to camp to be killed, though I suppose
it is possible. Certainly good fortune, or good
luck, or whatever else you choose to call it, does seem
to be pretty steadily on our side, and without the aid
of the fur-seal’s tooth either,” he added, with a sly
glance at Serge.</p>

<p>The latter was already hard at work cooking a bountiful
supply of the meat so wonderfully provided for
them, while Nel-te, who had been left to his own devices
for several minutes, had made his way to the
“doggies,” and was rolling over and over in the snow
with Musky and Luvtuk and big Amook. They were
treating him exactly as they would a frolicsome puppy,
and their joyous barkings were mingled with his
shrill screams of delight in a happy chorus. The little
chap could hardly be persuaded to leave his new playmates
long enough to eat dinner, and returned to them
the moment his appetite was satisfied.</p>

<p>As soon as the meal was finished Phil and Serge
slipped away, taking a sledge, to which was lashed a
couple of axes, with them. They were going back to
bury the parents of the child, who was so happily oblivious
of the sad nature of their errand that he did
not even take note of their departure.</p>

<p>The lads had no idea of how they should accomplish
their sorrowful task. Even with proper tools they
knew it would be impossible to dig a grave in the
frozen ground, and, as they had only axes with which
to work, this plan was dismissed without discussion.
They talked of building a tomb of logs, but decided
that to make it proof against wild beasts would take
more time than they could afford. Serge suggested a
scaffold, on which the bodies might be placed, in Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
fashion, while Phil thought that, by taking up the
floor of the cabin, they might find earth in which they
could dig. He could not bear the thought that one
who had been brought up in the ways of civilization,
and who had moreover suffered as had poor Ellen
McLeod, should have aught save a Christian burial;
and when he told Serge the sad story of her life as he
had learned it from the missionary at Anvik, the latter
agreed with him.</p>

<p>So they had not settled on any plan when they rounded
the last bend of the little stream and gained a point
from which the cabin should have been visible. Then
they saw at a glance that the task they had been dreading
had been accomplished without their aid. There
was no cabin; but a cloud of smoke rising from its site,
as from an altar, gave ample evidence of its fate. A
blazing log from the fire Phil left on its hearth must
have rolled out on the floor directly after his departure.
Now only a heap of ashes and glowing embers
remained to mark the site of Nel-te’s home.</p>

<p>“It is best so,” said Phil, as the two lads stood beside
the smouldering ruins of what had been a home
and was now become a sepulchre. “And oh, Serge!
think of what might have been the child’s fate if I
had left him behind, as I at first intended. Poor little
chap! I realize now, as never before, how completely
his past is wiped out, and how entirely his future lies
in our hands. It is a trust that came without our seeking,
but I accepted it; and now, beside his mother’s
ashes, I swear to be true to the promise I gave her.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” said Serge, softly, as though at the conclusion
of a prayer, and Phil knew that the little wilderness
orphan had found another friend who would
be as loyal as himself.</p>

<p>They planted a rude wooden cross, the face of which
was chipped to a gleaming whiteness, close in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the smouldering heap, and near it Serge fastened a
streamer of white cloth to the tip of a tall young
spruce. Cutting off the limbs as he descended, he left
it a slender pole, and thus provided the native symbol
of a place of burial.</p>

<p>Having thus done all that was left them to do, the
boys retraced their way down the little stream and up
the river, through the gathering dusk, to the camp
that to them was home.</p>

<p>As they approached it they were astonished to hear
Jalap Coombs singing in bellowing tones the rollicking
old sea chanty of “Roll a Man Down!”</p>

</div>

<p>Jalap’s voice was not musical, but it possessed a
mighty volume, and as the quaint sea chorus roared
and echoed through the stately forest, the very trees
appeared to be listening in silent wonder to the unaccustomed
sounds. Even Musky, Luvtuk, big Amook,
and the other dogs seemed by their dismal howlings
to be expressing either appreciation or disapprobation
of the sailor-man’s efforts.</p>

<p>The performers in this open-air concert were too
deeply intent on their own affairs to pay any heed to
the approach of the returning sledge party, who were
thus enabled to come within full view of a most extraordinary
scene unnoticed. Just beyond the camp,
in a semicircle, facing the fire, a dozen dogs, resting on
their haunches, lifted both their voices and sharp-pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
noses to the sky. On the opposite side of the
fire sat Jalap Coombs, holding Nel-te in his arms, rocking
him to and fro in time to the chorus that he was
pouring forth with the full power of his lungs, and utterly
oblivious to everything save his own unusual occupation
of putting a baby to sleep.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho!” roared Phil and Serge,
unable to restrain their mirth a moment longer. “Oh
my! oh my! Oh, Mr. Coombs, you’ll be the death of
me yet! Whatever are you doing? Didn’t know you
could sing! What a capital nurse you make! What
a soft voice for lullabies! The dogs, too! Oh dear!
I shall laugh at the thought of this if I live to be a
hundred! Don’t mind us, though. Keep right on.
Please do!”</p>

<p>But the concert was ended. Jalap Coombs sprang
to his feet with a startled yell, and dropped the child,
who screamed with the fright of his sudden awakening.
The dogs, whose harmonious howlings were so
abruptly interrupted, slunk away with tails between
their legs, and hid themselves in deepest shadows.</p>

<p>“There, there, little chap! Don’t be frightened,”
cried Phil, darting forward and picking up the child,
though still shaking with laughter. “It’s all right
now. Brother Phil will protect you, and not let the
big man frighten you any more.”</p>

<p>“I frighten him indeed!” retorted Jalap Coombs, indignantly.
“He was sleeping quiet and peaceful as a seal
pup; and I were jest humming a bit of a ditty that
useter be sung to me when I were a kid, so’s he’d have
something pleasant to dream about. Then you young
swabs had to come creeping up and yell like a couple
of wild hoodoos, and set the dogs to howling and scare
the kid, to say nothing of me, which ef I had ye aboard
ship I’d masthead ye both till ye larnt manners. Oh,
ye may snicker! But I have my opinion all the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of any man as’ll wake a sleeping child, specially when
he’s wore out with crying, all on account of being desarted.
And I’m not the only one nuther. There was
old Kite Roberson useter clap a muzzle onto his wife’s
canary whenever she’d get the kids to sleep, for fear
the critter’d bust into singing. But it’s all right.
You’ll know how it is yourselves some day.”</p>

<p>Phil, seeing that, for the first time since he had
known him, the mate was thoroughly indignant, set
out to smooth his ruffled feelings.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Coombs,” he said, “we didn’t mean to
startle you, but those wretched dogs kept up such a
howling that we couldn’t make ourselves heard as we
neared camp. I’m sure I don’t see how you could
think we were laughing at you. It was those absurd
dogs, and you’d have laughed yourself if you’d looked
up and seen them. I’m sure it was awfully good of
you to take so much trouble over this little fellow, and
put him so nicely to sleep with your sing—I mean
with your humming, though I assure you we didn’t hear
a hum.”</p>

<p>“Waal,” replied Jalap Coombs, somewhat mollified
by Phil’s attitude, “I warn’t humming very loud, not
nigh so loud as I had been at fust. Ye see, I were
kinder tapering off so as to lay the kid down, and begin
to get supper ’gainst you kim back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” said Phil, almost choking with suppressed
laughter. “But how did it happen that you
were compelled to act as nurse? The little chap
seemed happy enough when we went away.”</p>

<p>“So he were, till he found you was gone. Then he
begun to pipe his eye and set storm signals, and directly
it come on to blow a hurricane with heavy
squalls. So I had to stand by. Fust off I thought the
masts would surely go; but I took a reef here and
there, and kinder got things snugged down, till after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
a while the sky broke, the sun kim out, and fair weather
sot in once more.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Phil, admiringly, “you certainly acted
with the judgment of an A No. 1 seaman, and I don’t
believe even your esteemed friend Captain Robinson
could have done better. We shall call on you whenever
our little pilot gets into troubled waters again,
and feel that we are placing him in the best possible
hands.”</p>

<p>At which praise Jalap Coombs was greatly pleased,
and said as how he’d be proud at all times to stand by
the kid. Thus on the same day that little Nel-te McLeod
lost his parents he found a brother and two
stanch friends.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a><br />
<small>NEL-TE QUALIFIES AS A BRANCH PILOT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Although disappointed of their guide, there was
nothing for the sledge party to do but push on and
trust to their own good judgment to carry them safely
to the end of their journey. So as much of the moose
meat as could be loaded on a sledge, or several hundred
pounds in all, was prepared and frozen that evening.
Both then and in the morning the dogs were
given all they could eat—so much, in fact, that they
were greatly disinclined to travel during most of the
following day.</p>

<p>The latest addition to the party, after being rudely
awakened from the slumber into which Jalap Coombs’s
singing had lulled him, called pitifully for his mother,
and, refusing to be comforted, finally sobbed himself
to sleep on Phil’s bear-skin in front of the fire. Here
he spent the night, tucked warmly in a rabbit-skin
robe, nestled between Phil and Serge with all his sorrows
forgotten for the time being. In the early morning
he was a very sober little lad, with a grievance
that was not to be banished even by the sight of his
beloved “doggies,” while the advances of his human
friends were met by a dignified silence. He was too
hungry to refuse the food offered him by Serge; but
he ate it with a strictly business-like air, in which
there was nothing of unbending nor forgiveness. To
Phil’s attempts at conversation he turned a deaf ear,
nor would he even so much as smile when Jalap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Coombs made faces at him, or got down on hands and
knees and growled for his special benefit. He was
evidently not to be won by any such foolishness.</p>

<p>He was roused to an exhibition of slight interest by
the tinkling music of Musky’s bells when the dogs
were harnessed; and when, everything being ready for
a start, Phil lifted him on the foremost sledge, and
tucked him into a spare sleeping-bag that was securely
lashed to it, he murmured: “Mamma, Nel-te go mamma.”</p>

<p>The loads having been redistributed to provide for
the accommodation of the young passenger, this foremost
sledge bore, besides Nel-te, only the Forty Mile
mail, the sleeping equipment of the party, and their
extra fur clothing, the chynik, in which was stored the
small quantity of tea still remaining, what was left of
the pemmican, and an axe. As, with its load, it did
not weigh over two hundred pounds, its team was reduced
to three dogs, Musky, Luvtuk, and big Amook.
Serge still drove seven dogs, and his sledge bore the
entire camp equipment and stock of provisions, except
the recently acquired moose meat. This was loaded
on the last sledge, which was drawn by five dogs, and
driven by Jalap Coombs according to his own peculiar
fashion.</p>

<p>As soon as the sledges were in motion, and Nel-te
conceived the idea that he was going home, his spirits
revived to such an extent that he chirruped cheerfully
to the dogs, and even smiled occasionally at Phil, who
strode alongside.</p>

<p>They crossed Fox Lake, passed up the stream that
connected it with Indian Trail Lake, and finally went
into camp on the edge of the forest at the head of the
latter earlier than usual, because they could not see
their way to the making of any further progress. Although
they felt certain that there must be some stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
flowing into the lake by which they could leave it,
they could discover no sign of its opening. So they
made camp, and, leaving Jalap Coombs to care for it,
Phil and Serge departed in opposite directions to scan
every foot of the shore in search of a place of exit.</p>

<p>On reaching this camping-place Nel-te looked about
him inquiringly and with evident disappointment, but
he said nothing, and only gazed wistfully after the two
lads when they set forth on their search. For a time
he hung about the camp-fire watching Jalap Coombs,
who was too busily engaged in cooking supper and
preparing for the night to pay much attention to him.
At length the little chap strolled over to the sledges,
and engaged in a romp with the three dogs who dragged
his particular conveyance. Every now and then his
shrill laughter came to Jalap’s ears, and assured the
latter that the child was safe.</p>

<p>After a while the explorers returned, both completely
discouraged and perplexed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is any inlet to this wretched
lake!” cried Phil, flinging himself down on a pile of
robes. “I’ve searched every foot of coast on my side,
and am willing to swear that there isn’t an opening
big enough for a rabbit to squeeze through, so far as I
went.”</p>

<p>“Nor could I find a sign of one,” affirmed Serge,
“though perhaps in the morning—”</p>

<p>“Hello! Where’s Nel-te?” interrupted Phil, springing
to his feet and gazing about him anxiously.</p>

<p>“He were about here jest as you boys kim in,” replied
Jalap Coombs, suspending operations at the fire,
and gazing about him with a startled expression. “I
heered him playing with the dogs not more’n a minute
ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t in sight now,” said Phil, in a voice
whose tone betrayed his alarm, “and if we don’t find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
him in a hurry there’s a chance of our not doing it at
all, for it will be dark in fifteen minutes more.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Phil hastily replaced the snow-shoes
that he had just laid aside. Serge did the same thing,
and then they began to circle about the camp with
heads bent low in search of the tiny trail. At short
intervals they called aloud the name of the missing
one, but only the mocking forest echoes answered
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Serge uttered a joyful shout. He had
found the prints of small snow-shoes crossed and recrossed
by those of dogs. In a moment Phil joined
him, and the two followed the trail together. It led
for a short distance along the border of the lake in the
direction previously taken by Phil, and then, making a
sharp bend to the right, struck directly into the forest.</p>

<p>When the boys reached the edge of the timber they
found a low opening so overhung by bushes as to be
effectually concealed from careless observation. The
curtaining growth was so bent down with a weight of
snow that even Nel-te must have stooped to pass under
it. That he had gone that way was shown by the trail
still dimly visible in the growing dusk, and the lads
did not hesitate to follow. Forcing a path through
the bushes, which extended only a few yards back
from the lake, they found themselves in an open highway,
evidently the frozen surface of a stream.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Phil, who was the first to gain
it. “I believe this is the very creek we have been
searching for. It must be, and the little chap has
found it for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Serge. “It begins to look as though
Cree Jim’s son had taken Cree Jim’s place as guide.”</p>

<p>Now the boys pushed forward with increased speed.
At length they heard the barking of dogs, and began
to shout, but received no answer. They had gone a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
full quarter of a mile from the lake ere they caught
sight of the little fur-clad figure plodding steadily
forward on what he fondly hoped to be his way towards
home and the mother for whom his baby heart so
longed. Musky, Luvtuk, and big Amook were his
companions, and not until he was caught up in Phil’s
arms did the child so much as turn his head or pay the
slightest heed to those who followed his trail.</p>

<p>As he was borne back in triumph towards camp his
lower lip quivered, and two big tears rolled down his
chubby cheeks, but he did not cry nor utter a complaint;
nor from that time on did he make further
effort to regain his lost home. The boys had hardly
begun to retrace their steps when another figure
loomed out of the shadows and came rapidly towards
them. It looked huge in the dim light, and advanced
with gigantic strides.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Phil, as he recognized the new-comer.
“Where are you bound?”</p>

<p>“Bound to get lost along with the rest of the crew,”
replied Jalap Coombs, stoutly. “Didn’t I tell ye I
wouldn’t put up with your gettin’ lost alone ag’in?”</p>

<p>“That’s so; but you see I forgot,” laughed Phil.
“Now that we are all found, though, let’s get back to
the supper that you were cooking before you decided
to get lost. By the way, Mr. Coombs, do you realize
that this is the very stream for which we have been
hunting? What do you think of our young pilot now?”</p>

<p>“Think of him!” exclaimed Jalap Coombs. “I
think he’s jest the same as all in the piloting business—pernicketty.
Knows a heap more’n he’ll ever tell, and
won’t ever p’int out a channel till you’re just about to
run aground. Then he’ll do it kinder keerless and onconsarned,
same as the kid done jest now. Oh, he’s a
regular branch pilot, he is, and up to all the tricks of
the trade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Bright and early the following morning, thanks to
Nel-te’s pilotage, the sledges were speeding up the
creek on their way to Lost Lake. By nightfall they
had crossed it, three other small lakes, descended an
outlet of the last to Little Salmon River, and after a
run of five miles down that stream found themselves
once more amid the ice hummocks of the Yukon, one
hundred and twenty miles above the mouth of the
Pelly. Of this distance they had saved about one-third
by their adventurous cut-off.</p>

<p>The end of another week found them one hundred
and fifty miles farther up the Yukon and at the mouth
of the Tahkeena. It had been a week of the roughest
kind of travel, and its hard work was telling severely on
the dogs.</p>

<p>As they made their last camp on the mighty river
they were to leave for good on the morrow, they were
both glad and sorry. Glad to leave its rough ice and
escape the savage difficulties that it offered in the
shape of cañons and roaring rapids only a few miles
above, and sorry to desert its well-marked course for
the little-known Tahkeena.</p>

<p>Still, their dogs could not hold out for another week
on the Yukon, while over the smooth going of the
tributary stream they might survive the hardships of
the journey to its very end; and without these faithful
servants our travellers would indeed be in a sorry
plight. So, while they reminisced before their roaring
camp-fire of the many adventures they had encountered
since entering Yukon mouth, two thousand miles
away, they looked hopefully forward to their journey’s
end, now less than as many hundred miles from that
point. To the dangers of the lofty mountain range
they had yet to cross they gave but little thought, for
the mountains were still one hundred miles away.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a><br />
<small>THE FUR-SEAL’S TOOTH CREATES A SENSATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One evening late in March the smoke of a lonely
camp-fire curled above a fringe of stunted spruces
forming the timber-line high up on the northern slope
of the Alaskan coast range. Kotusk, the natives call
these mountains. Far below lay the spotless sheet of
Takh Lake, from which the Tahkeena winds for one
hundred miles down its rugged valley to swell the
Yukon flood. From the foot of the mountains the unbroken
solitude of the vast northern wilderness swept
away in ice-bound silence to the polar sea. Far to the
westward St. Elias and Wrangel, the great northern
sentinels of the Rocky Mountain system, reared their
massive heads nearly twenty thousand feet above the
Pacific. From them the mighty range of snow-clad
peaks follows the coast line eastward, gathering with
icy fingers the mist clouds ever rising from the warm
ocean waters, converting them with frigid breath into
the grandest glaciers of the continent, and sending
these slowly grinding their resistless way back to the
sea.</p>

<p>On one side of this stupendous barrier our sledge
party from the Yukon was now halted. On the other
lay the frontier of civilization, safety, and their journey’s
end. Between the two points rose the mountains,
calmly contemptuous of human efforts to penetrate
their secrets of avalanche and glacier, icy precipice
and snow-filled gorge, fierce blizzard and ice-laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
whirlwind, desolation and death. It is no wonder that,
face to face with such things, the little group, gathered
about the last camp-fire they might see for days or
perhaps forever, should be unusually quiet and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>Still clad in their well-worn garments of fur, they
were engaged in characteristic occupations. Phil, looking
anxious and careworn, was standing close to the
fire warming and cleaning his rifle. Serge was making
a stew of the last of their moose meat, which would
afterwards be frozen and taken with them into untimbered
regions where camp-fires would be unknown.
Jalap Coombs was thoughtfully mending a broken
snow-shoe, and at the same time finding his task sadly
interrupted by Nel-te, who, nestled between his knees,
was trying to attract the sailor-man’s undivided attention.</p>

<p>The little chap, with his great sorrow forgotten, was
now the life and pet of the party. So firmly was his
place established among them that they wondered how
they had ever borne the loneliness of a camp without
his cheery presence, and could hardly realize that he
had only recently come into their lives. Now, too,
half the anxiety with which they regarded the perilous
way before them was on his account.</p>

<p>“I’m worrying most about the dogs,” said Phil, continuing
a conversation begun some time before, “and
I am afraid some of them will give out before we
reach the summit.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Serge; “to-day’s pull up from the
lake has told terribly on them, and Amook’s feet have
been badly cut by the crust ever since he ate his boots.”</p>

<p>“Poor old dog!” said Phil. “It was awfully careless
of me to forget and leave them on him all night.
I don’t wonder a bit at his eating them, though, considering
the short rations he’s been fed on lately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The dogs were indeed having a hard time. Worn
by months of sledge-pulling over weary leagues of
snow and ice, their trials only increased as the tedious
journey progressed. The days were now so long that
each offered a full twelve hours of sunlight, while the
snow was so softened by the growing warmth that in
the middle of the day it seriously clogged both snow-shoes
and sledges. Then a crust would form, through
which the poor dogs would break for an hour or more,
until it stiffened sufficiently to bear their weight.
Added to these tribulations was such a scarcity of
food that half-rations had become the rule for every
one, men as well as dogs, excepting Nel-te, who had
not yet been allowed to suffer on that account. Of
the many dogs that had been connected with the
expedition at different times only nine were now
left, and some of these would evidently not go much
farther.</p>

<p>As the boys talked of the condition of these trusty
servants, and exchanged anxious forebodings concerning
the crossing of the mountains, their attention was
attracted by an exclamation from Jalap Coombs.
Nel-te had been so insistent in demanding his attention
that the sailor-man was finally obliged to lay aside
his work and lift the child to his knees, saying,</p>

<p>“Waal, Cap’n Kid, what’s the orders now, sir?”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Kid” was the name he had given to the little
fellow on the occasion of the latter’s début as pilot;
for, as he said, “Every branch pilot answers to the hail
of cap’n, and this one being a kid becomes ‘Cap’n Kid’
by rights.”</p>

<p>For answer to his question the child held out a
small fur-booted foot, and intimated that the boot
should be pulled off.</p>

<p>“Bad foot, hurt Nel-te,” he said.</p>

<p>“So! something gone wrong with your running rigging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
eh?” queried Jalap Coombs, as he pulled off the
offending boot. Before he could investigate it the
little chap reached forward, and, thrusting a chubby
hand down to its very toe, drew forth in triumph the
object that had been annoying him. As he made a
motion to fling it out into the snow, Jalap Coombs,
out of curiosity to see what had worried the child,
caught his hand. The next moment he uttered the
half-terrified exclamation that attracted the attention
of Phil and Serge.</p>

<p>As they looked they saw him holding to the firelight
between thumb and finger, and beyond reach of Nel-te,
who was striving to regain it, an object so strange and
yet so familiar that for a moment they regarded it in
speechless amazement.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp214">“The fur-seal’s tooth!”</a> cried Phil. “How can it
be?”</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_214">THE FUR-SEAL’S TOOTH CREATES A SENSATION</a></div>
</div>

<p>“It can’t be our fur-seal’s tooth,” objected Serge, in
a tone of mingled incredulity and awe. “There must
be several of them.”</p>

<p>“I should think so myself,” replied Phil, who had
taken the object in question from Jalap Coombs for a
closer examination, “if it were not for a private mark
that I scratched on it when it was in our possession at
St. Michaels. See, here it is, and so the identity of
the tooth is established beyond a doubt. But how it
ever got here I cannot conceive. There is actually
something supernatural about the whole thing. Where
did you say you found it, Mr. Coombs?”</p>

<p>“In Cap’n Kid’s boot,” replied the mate, who had
just restored that article to the child’s foot. “But
blow me for a porpus ef I kin understand how ever it
got there. Last time I seen it ’twas back to Forty
Mile.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Serge, “Judge Riley had it.”</p>

<p>“I remember seeing him put it into a vest-pocket,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
added Phil, “and meant to ask him for it, but forgot
to do so. Now to have it appear from the boot of
that child, who has never been to Forty Mile, or certainly
not since we left there, is simply miraculous.
It beats any trick of spiritualism or conjuring I ever
heard of. The mystery of the tooth’s appearing at St.
Michaels after my father lost it, only a short time before
at Oonalaska, was strange enough; but that was
nothing to this.”</p>

<p>“There must be magic in it,” said Serge, who from
early associations was inclined to be superstitious.
“I don’t care, though, if there is,” he added, stoutly.
“I believe the tooth has come to us at this time of our
despondency as an omen of good-fortune, and now I
feel certain that we shall pull through all right. You
remember, Phil, the saying that goes with it: ‘He
who receives it as a gift receives good-luck.’”</p>

<p>“Who has received it as a gift this time?” inquired
the Yankee lad.</p>

<p>“We all have, though it seems to have been especially
sent to Nel-te, and you know he is the one we
were most anxious about.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented Phil, “and from this time on
Nel-te shall wear it as a charm, though I suppose it
won’t stay with him any longer than suits its convenience.
I never had a superstition in my life, and
haven’t believed in such things, but I must confess that
my unbelief is shaken by this affair. There isn’t any
possible way, that I can see, for this tooth to have got
here except by magic of some kind.”</p>

<p>“It beats the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> and merrymaids,”
said Jalap Coombs, solemnly, as he lighted his pipe
for a quieting smoke. “D’ye know, lads, I’m coming
to think as how it were all on account of this ’ere curio
being aboard the steamer <i>Norsk</i> that she stopped and
picked you up in Bering Sea that night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried Phil. “That is impossible.”</p>

<p>Thus purely through ignorance this lad, who was
usually so sensible and level-headed, declared with one
breath his belief in an impossibility, and with the next
his disbelief of a fact. All of which serves to illustrate
the folly of making assertions concerning subjects
about which we are ignorant. There is nothing so
mysterious that it cannot be explained, and nothing
more foolish than to declare a thing impossible simply
because we are too ignorant to understand it.</p>

<p>In the present case Serge and Jalap Coombs, and
even Phil, who should have known better, were ready
to believe that the fur-seal’s tooth had come to them
through some supernatural agency, because, in their
ignorance, they could not imagine how it could have
come in any other way. We laugh at their simplicity
because of our wisdom. We saw Mr. Platt Riley drop
the tooth into one of their sleeping-bags at Forty Mile.
Knowing this, it is easy to understand how that same
sleeping-bag, which happened to be the extra one acquired
by the turning over to Jalap Coombs of Strengel’s
stolen property, should be selected as Nel-te’s
travelling-bag, and lashed to a sledge for his occupancy
in the daytime. In his restlessness he had kicked the
tooth about until it finally worked its way into one of his
little fur boots, and that is all there was to the mystery.</p>

<p>Still, it afforded a fertile topic for conversation
around that lonely mountain-side camp-fire long after
Phil had strung it on a buckskin thong and hung it
about the child’s neck, at the same time taking the
precaution to tuck it snugly inside his little fur parka.
All agreed that they were glad to have the fur-seal’s
tooth in their possession once more; and on account
of its presence among them they were ready to face
the difficulties that would confront them on the morrow
with a cheerful confidence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a><br />
<small>LOST IN A MOUNTAIN BLIZZARD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Tired as were the occupants of that lonely camp
after a day of exhausting climbing up through the
timber, their slumbers were broken and restless. The
uncertainties of the morrow, the peculiar nature of the
road they had yet to travel, and the excitement consequent
upon nearing the end of their journey, which none
of them believed to be over fifty miles away, all combined
to render them wakeful and uneasy. So they were
up by the first sign of daylight, and off before sunrise.</p>

<p>As there were now but three dogs to a sledge, the
load of the one driven by Serge was divided between
it and the one that brought up the rear in charge of
Jalap Coombs. A few sticks of dry wood were also
placed on each sledge, so that in crossing the upper
ice-fields they might at least be able to melt snow for
drinking purposes.</p>

<p>“Now for it!” cried Phil, cheerfully, as they emerged
from the scanty timber, and shivered in the chill blast
that swept down from the towering peaks above them.
Between two of these was a saddle-like depression that
they took to be the pass, and to it the young leader determined
to guide his little party.</p>

<p>“Up you go, Musky!” he shouted. “Pull, Luvtuk,
my pigeon! Amook, you old rascal, show what you
are good for! A little more work, a little more hunger,
and then rest, with plenty to eat. So stir yourselves
and climb!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>With this the long whip-lash whistled through the
frosty air and cracked with a resounding report that
would have done credit to the most expert of Eskimo
drivers, for our Phil was no longer a novice in its use,
and with a yelp the dogs sprang forward.</p>

<p>Up, up, up they climbed, until, as Phil remarked, it
didn’t seem as though the top of the world could be
very far away. The sun rose and flooded the snowfields
with such dazzling radiance that but for their
protecting goggles our travellers must have been completely
blinded by the glare. The deep gulch whose
windings they followed held in summer-time a roaring
torrent; but now it was filled with solidly packed snow
from twenty-five to one hundred feet deep.</p>

<p>As they advanced the gulch grew more and more
shallow, until at length it was merged in a broad, uniform
slope so steep and slippery that they were obliged
to cut footholds in the snow, and at frequent intervals
carve out little benches two feet wide. From one of
these to another they dragged the sledges, one at a
time, with rawhide ropes. Even the dogs had to be
assisted up the glassy incline, on which they could
gain no hold. So arduous was this labor that three
hours were spent in overcoming the last five hundred
feet of the ascent. Thus it was long past noon when,
breathless and exhausted, the party reached the summit,
or rather a slope so gentle that the dogs could
once more drag the sledges.</p>

<p>Here, at an elevation of nearly five thousand feet
above the sea, they paused for breath, for a bite of
lunch, and for a last look back over the way they had
come. From this elevation their view embraced a
sweep of over one hundred miles of mountain and
plain, river and forest. It was so far-reaching and
boundless that it even seemed as if they could take in
the whole vast Yukon Valley, and locate points that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
common-sense told them were a thousand miles beyond
their range of vision. Grand as was the prospect,
they did not care to look at it long. Time was
precious; the air, in spite of its sunlight, was bitterly
chill, and, after all, the mighty wilderness now behind
them held too many memories of hardship, suffering,
and danger to render it attractive.</p>

<p>So, “Hurrah for the coast!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Sitka!” echoed Serge.</p>

<p>“Hooray for salt water! Now, bullies, up and at
’em!” roared Jalap Coombs, expressing a sentiment
and an order to his sailor-bred dogs in a breath.</p>

<p>In a few moments more the wonderful view had
disappeared, and the sledges were threading their way
amid a chaos of gigantic bowlders and snow-covered
landslides from the peaks that rose on both sides.
There was no sharp descent from the summit, such as
they had hoped to find, but instead a lofty plateau
piled thick with obstructions. About them no green
thing was to be seen, no sign of life; only snow, ice,
and precipitous cliffs of bare rock. The all-pervading
and absolute silence was awful. There was no trail
that might be followed, for the hardiest of natives
dared not attempt that crossing in the winter. Even
if they had, their trail would have been obliterated
almost as soon as made by the fierce storms of those
altitudes. So their only guide was that of general direction,
which they knew to be south, and to this course
Phil endeavored to hold.</p>

<p>That night they made a chill camp in the lee of a
great bowlder; that is, in as much of a lee as could be
had, where the icy blast swept in circles and eddies
from all directions at once. They started a fire, but
its feeble flame was so blown hither and thither that
by the time a kettle of snow was melted and the ice
was thawed from their stew, their supply of wood was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
so depleted that they dared not use more. So they
ate their scanty supper without tea, fed the dogs on
frozen porridge, and, huddling together for warmth
during the long hours of bleak darkness, were thankful
enough to welcome the gray dawn that brought them
to an end.</p>

<p>For three days more they toiled over the terrible
plateau, driven to long détours by insurmountable
obstacles, buffeted and lashed by fierce snow-squalls
and ice-laden gales, but ever pushing onward with
unabated courage, expecting with each hour to find
themselves descending into the valley of the Chilkat
River. Two of the dogs driven by Serge broke down
so completely that they were mercifully shot. The
third dog was added to Jalap Coombs’s team, and the
load was divided between the remaining sledges, while
the now useless one was used as firewood. After that
Phil plodded on in advance, and Serge drove the leading
team.</p>

<p>The fourth day of this terrible work was one of
leaden clouds and bitter winds. The members of the
little party were growing desperate with cold, exhaustion,
and hunger. Their wanderings had not brought
them to a timber-line, and as poor Phil faced the blast
with bowed head and chattering teeth it seemed to
him that to be once more thoroughly warm would be
the perfection of human happiness.</p>

<p>It was already growing dusk, and he was anxiously
casting about for the sorry shelter of some bowlder
behind which they might shiver away the hours of
darkness, when he came to the verge of a steep declivity.
His heart leaped as he glanced down its precipitous
face; for, far below, he saw a dark mass that
he knew must be timber. They could not descend at
that point; but he thought he saw one that appeared
more favorable a little farther on, and hastened in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
direction. He was already some distance ahead of the
slow-moving sledges, and meant to wait for them as
soon as he discovered a place from which the descent
could be made.</p>

<p>Suddenly a whirling, blinding cloud of snow swept
down on him with such fury that to face it and
breathe was impossible. Thinking it but a squall, he
turned his back and stood motionless, waiting for it to
pass over. Instead of so doing, it momentarily increased
in violence and density. A sudden darkness
came with the storm, and as he anxiously started back
to meet the sledges he could not see one rod before
him. He began to shout, and in a few minutes had
the satisfaction of hearing an answering cry. Directly
afterwards Serge loomed through the driving cloud,
urging on his reluctant dogs with voice and whip.
The moment they were allowed to stop, Musky,
Luvtuk, and big Amook lay down as though completely
exhausted.</p>

<p>“We can’t go a step farther, Phil! We must make
camp at once,” panted Serge. “This storm is a regular
<em>poorga</em>, and will probably last all night.”</p>

<p>“But where can we camp?” asked Phil, in dismay.
“There is timber down below, but it looks miles away,
and we can’t get to it now.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Serge; “we must stay where we are,
and burrow a hole in this drift big enough to hold us.
We’ve got to do it in a hurry, too.”</p>

<p>So saying, Serge drew his knife, for the outside of
the drift close to which they were halted was so hard
packed as to render cutting necessary, and outlined a
low opening. From this he removed an unbroken
slab, and then began to dig furiously in the soft snow
beyond.</p>

<p>In the meantime Phil was wondering why Jalap
Coombs did not appear, for he had supposed him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
be close behind Serge; but now his repeated shoutings
gained no reply.</p>

<p>“He was not more than one hundred feet behind
me when the storm began,” said Serge, whose anxiety
caused him to pause in his labor, though it was for the
preservation of their lives.</p>

<p>“He must be in some trouble,” said Phil, “and I am
going back to find him.”</p>

<p>“You can’t go alone!” said Serge. “If you are to
get lost I must go with you.”</p>

<p>“No. One of us must stay here with Nel-te, and it
is my duty to go; but do you shout every few seconds,
and I promise not to go beyond sound of your voice.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, Phil started back, and was instantly
swallowed in the vortex of the blizzard. Faithfully
did Serge shout, and faithfully did Phil answer, for
nearly fifteen minutes. Then the latter came staggering
back, with horror-stricken face and voice.</p>

<p>“I can’t find him, Serge! Oh, I can’t find him!”
he cried. “I am afraid he has gone over the precipice.
If he has, it is my fault, and I shall never forgive myself,
for I had no business to go so far ahead and let
the party get scattered.”</p>

<p>Serge answered not a word, but fell with desperate
energy to the excavating of his snow-house. His heart
was near breaking with the sorrow that had overtaken
them, but he was determined that no other lives should
be lost if his efforts could save them. The excavation
was soon so large that Phil could work with him, but
with all their furious digging they secured a shelter
from the pitiless <em>poorga</em> none too soon. The sledge
was already buried from sight, and poor little Nel-te
was wellnigh smothered ere they lifted him from it
and pulled him into the burrow.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a><br />
<small>COASTING FIVE MILES IN FIVE MINUTES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In spite of their faintness and weakness from hunger
and exhaustion, Phil and Serge were so stimulated
by the emergency that within half an hour they had
dug a cavity in the great drift sufficiently large to
hold the three dogs as well as themselves. The excavation
was driven straight for a few feet, and then
turned to one side, where it was so enlarged that they
could either lie down or sit up. Into this diminutive
chamber they dragged their robes and sleeping-bags.
The shivering dogs crept in and curled up at their
feet. The sledge was left outside, and the opening
was closed as well as might be by the slab of compacted
snow that had been cut from it.</p>

<p>Poor little Nel-te, who was numbed and whimpering
with cold and hunger, was rubbed into a glow,
comforted, and petted, until at length he fell asleep,
nestled between the lads, and then they found time to
talk over their situation. For a while they had no
thought save for the dear friend and trusty comrade
who, alive or dead, was still out in that terrible storm,
and, as they believed, lost to them forever.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there is the faintest hope of ever
seeing him again,” said Phil. “If he went over the
precipice he must have been killed, and is buried deep
in the snow by this time. Even if he did not, and is
still wandering somewhere in this vicinity, he must
perish before morning. Oh, Serge, can’t we do anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
for him? It makes me feel like a cowardly traitor
to be sitting here in comfort while the dear old
chap may be close at hand, and perishing for want of
our help. And it is my fault, too! The fault of my
inexcusable carelessness. It seems, old man, as if I
should go crazy with thinking of it.”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t think of it in that way, Phil,” answered
Serge, soothingly. “As leader of the party it
was your duty to go ahead and pick out the road, while
it was ours to keep you in sight. If either of us is to
blame for what has happened, I am the one. I should
have looked back oftener, and made sure that he was
still close behind me. Now there is nothing we can
do except wait for daylight and the end of the storm.
We have our parents, this child, and ourselves to think
of first. Nor could we accomplish anything even if
we tried. The storm has doubled in fury since we
halted. A foot of snow must already have fallen, and
to venture a single rod outside of this place would
serve to lose us as certainly as though we went a mile.
We mustn’t give up all hope, though. Mr. Coombs is
very strong, and well used to exposure. Of course, if
he has gone over the precipice there is little chance
that we shall ever see him again; but if he escaped it,
and has made a burrow for himself like this one, he will
pull through all right, and we shall find him in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t we dug places like this before?”
asked Phil. “It is actually getting warm and comfortable
in here. We might have had just such a
warm cave every night that we have been in the mountains
and spent so miserably.”</p>

<p>“Of course we might,” agreed Serge, “and we would
have had but for my stupidity in not thinking of it
sooner. While I never took refuge in one before, I
have often heard of them, and ought to have remembered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
I didn’t, though, until this storm struck us,
and I knew that without shelter we must certainly
perish.”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t thought of a snow-burrow,” said
Phil, “it is certain I never should. It is snug, though,
and if only poor Jalap were with us, and we had food
and a light of some kind, I wouldn’t ask for a better
shelter. I can understand now how an Eskimo stone
lamp, with seal-oil for fuel and a wick of moss, can give
out all the heat that is needed in one of their snow-huts,
and I only wish we had brought one with us.”</p>

<p>After this the boys grew drowsy, their conversation
slackened, and soon all their troubles were forgotten
in sleep. Outside, through the long hours, the gale
roared and shrieked with impotent rage at their escape
from its clutches. It hurled its snow legions against
their place of refuge until it was deep buried, and then
in a frenzy tore away and scattered the drifted accumulation,
until it could once more beat directly upon
their slender wall of defence. But its wiles and its
furious attacks were alike in vain, and at length its
fierce ravings sank into whispers. The <em>poorga</em> spent
its force with the darkness, and at daylight had swept
on to inland fields, leaving only an added burden of
a million tons of snow to mark its passage across the
mountains.</p>

<p>When the boys awoke a soft white light was filtering
through one side of their spotless chamber, and
they knew that day had come. They expected to dig
their way to the outer air through a great mass of
snow, and were agreeably surprised to find only a
small drift against the doorway. As they emerged
from it they were for a few minutes blinded by the
marvellous brilliancy of their sunlit surroundings.
Gradually becoming accustomed to the intense light,
they gazed eagerly about for some sign of their missing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
comrade, but there was none. They followed
back for a mile over the way they had come the evening
before, shouting and firing their guns, but without
avail.</p>

<p>No answering shout came back to their straining
ears, and there was nothing to indicate the fate of the
lost man. Sadly and soberly the lads retraced their
steps, and prepared to resume their journey. To remain
longer in that place meant starvation and death.
To save themselves they must push on.</p>

<p>They shuddered at the precipice they had escaped,
and over which they feared their comrade had plunged.
At its foot lay a valley, which, though it trended
westward, and so away from their course, Phil determined
to follow; for, far below their lofty perch,
and still miles away from where they stood, it held
the dark mass he had seen the night before, and knew
to be timber. Besides, his sole desire at that moment
was to escape from those awful heights and reach
the coast at some point; he hardly cared whether it
were inhabited or not.</p>

<p>So the sledge was dug from its bed of snow, reloaded,
and the dogs were harnessed. Poor little Nel-te,
crying with hunger, was slipped into his fur travelling-bag,
and a start was made to search for some point of
descent. At length they found a place where the
slope reached to the very top of the cliff, but so
sharply that it was like the steep roof of a house
several miles in length.</p>

<p>“I hate the looks of it,” said Phil, “but as there
doesn’t seem to be any other way, I suppose we’ve got
to try it. I should say that for at least three miles it
is as steep as the steepest part of a toboggan-slide,
though, and I’m pretty certain we sha’n’t care to try
it more than once.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can do it all right,” replied Serge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
“but there’s only one way, and that is to sit on a snow-shoe
and slide. We couldn’t keep on our feet a single
second.”</p>

<p>They lifted Nel-te, fur bag and all, from the sledge,
tightened the lashings of its load, which included the
guns and extra snow-shoes, and started it over the
verge. It flashed down the declivity like a rocket, and
the last they saw of it it was rolling over and over.</p>

<p>“Looks cheerful, doesn’t it?” said Phil, grimly.
“Now I’ll go; then do you start the dogs down, and
come yourself as quick as you please.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, the plucky lad seated himself on a
snow-shoe, took Nel-te, still in the fur bag, in his lap,
and launched himself over the edge of the cliff. <a href="#i_frontis">For a
moment the sensation</a>, which was that of falling from
a great height, <a href="#i_frontis">was sickening</a>, and a thick mist seemed
to obscure his vision. Then it cleared away, and was
followed by a feeling of the wildest exhilaration as he
heard the whistling backward rush of air, and realized
the tremendous speed at which he was whizzing through
space. Ere it seemed possible that he could have
gone half-way to the timber-line, trees began to fly
past him, and he knew that the worst was over. In
another minute he was floundering in a drift of soft
snow, into which he had plunged up to his neck, and
the perilous feat was accomplished.</p>

<p>Poor Serge arrived at the same point shortly afterwards,
head first, and dove out of sight in the drift;
but fortunately Phil was in a position to extricate him
before he smothered. The dogs appeared a moment
later, with somewhat less velocity, but badly demoralized,
and evidently feeling that they had been sadly
ill-treated. So the sledge party had safely descended
in five minutes a distance equal to that which they
had spent half a day and infinite toil in ascending on
the other side of the mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>When Nel-te was released from the fur bag and set
on his feet he was as calm and self-possessed as though
nothing out of the usual had happened, and immediately
demanded something to eat.</p>

<p>After a long search they discovered the sledge, with
only one rail broken and its load intact.</p>

<p>“Now for a fire and breakfast!” cried Phil, heading
towards the timber as soon as the original order
of things was restored. “After that we will make one
more effort to find some trace of poor Jalap, though
I don’t believe there is the slightest chance of success.”</p>

<p>They entered the forest of wide-spreading but
stunted evergreens, and Phil, axe in hand, was vigorously
attacking a dead spruce, when an exclamation
from his companion caused him to pause in his labor
and look around.</p>

<p>“What can that be?” asked Serge, pointing to a
thick hemlock that stood but a few yards from them.
The lower ends of its drooping branches were deep
buried in snow, but such part as was still visible was
in a strange state of agitation.</p>

<p>“It must be a bear,” replied Phil, dropping his axe
and springing to the sledge for his rifle. “His winter
den is in there, and we have disturbed him. Get out
your gun—quick! We can’t afford to lose him. Meat’s
too scarce in camp just now.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, and before the guns could be
taken from their moose-skin cases, the motion of the
branches increased, there came a violent upheaval of
the snow that weighted them down, and the boys
caught a glimpse of some huge shaggy animal issuing
from the powdered whiteness.</p>

<p>“Hurry!” cried Phil. “No, look out! We’re too
late! What? Great Scott! It can’t be! Yes, it is!
Hurrah! Glory, hallelujah! I knew he’d pull through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
all right, and I believe I’m the very happiest fellow in
all the world at this minute.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe you be, son,” remarked Jalap Coombs,
“and then again mebbe there’s others as is equally
joyful. As my old friend Kite Roberson useter say,
‘A receiver’s as good as a thief,’ and I sartainly received
a heap of pleasure through hearing you holler
jest now.”</p>

<small>HOW JALAP COOMBS MADE PORT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The things on which we are apt to set the highest
value in this world are those that we have lost, and
even our friends are as a rule most highly appreciated
after they have been taken from us. Thus, in the present
instance, Phil and Serge had so sincerely mourned
the loss of their quaint but loyal comrade that his restoration
to them alive and well, “hearty <em>and</em> hungry,”
as he himself expressed it, filled them with unbounded
joy. They hung about him, and lovingly brushed the
snow from his fur clothing, and plied him with questions,
and made so much of him that he finally exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Avast, lads, and let up! Ye make me feel like I
were reading my own obituary in print, which my old
friend Kite Roberson were the only mortal man ever I
knowed as had that onhappy pleasure. It happened
when he were lost at sea, with his ship and all hands,
in latitood 24.06 nothe, and longitood 140.15 west,
’cording to the noosepapers; while, ’cording to Kite’s
log, he were cutting in of a fin-back and having the
best of luck at that very place <em>and</em> hour. Anyway,
whether he were drownded or no, he kim back in time
to enjoy the mortification of reading the notice of his
own taking off, which he said it made him feel ashamed
to be alive, seeing as he were a so much better man
after he were dead. Them’s about the size of my feelings
at the present hour of observation. So ef you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
boys don’t let up I reckon I’ll have to crawl back in
the snow <em>and</em> stay there.”</p>

<p>Even Nel-te showed delight at the return of his
playmate by cuddling up to him, and stroking his
weather-beaten cheeks, and confiding to him how very
hungry he was.</p>

<p>“Me, too, Cap’n Kid!” exclaimed Jalap Coombs;
“and I must say you’re a mighty tempting mossel to
a man as nigh starved as I be. Jest about broiling age,
plump <em>and</em> tender. Cap’n Kid, look out, for I’m mighty
inclined to stow ye away.”</p>

<p>“Try this instead,” laughed Phil, holding out a
chunk of frozen pemmican that he had just chopped
off. “We’re in the biggest kind of luck to-day,” he
continued. “I didn’t know there was a mouthful of
anything to eat on this sledge, and here I’ve just found
about five pounds of pemmican. It does seem to me the
very best pemmican that ever was put up, too, and I
only wonder that we didn’t eat it long ago. I’m going
to get my aunt Ruth to make me a lot of it just as
soon as ever I get home.”</p>

<p>By this time the fire was blazing merrily, and the
chynik was beginning to sing. Musky, Luvtuk, and
big Amook had each received a portion of the precious
pemmican, swallowed it at a gulp, and were
wagging their bushy tails in anxious expectation of
more, while the spirits of the whole party were at the
top-notch of contentment.</p>

<p>As they sat before the fire on a tree felled and
stripped of its branches for the purpose, and munched
frozen pemmican, and took turns in sipping strong unsweetened
tea from the only cup now left to them,
Jalap Coombs described his thrilling experiences of
the preceding night.</p>

<p>According to his story, one of his dogs gave out, and
he stopped to unharness it with the hope that it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
still have strength to follow the sledge. While he
was thus engaged the storm broke, the blinding rush
of snow swept over the mountains, and as he looked
up he found to his dismay that the other sledge was
already lost to view. He at once started to overtake
it, urging on the reluctant dogs by every means in his
power; but after a few minutes of struggle against
the furious gale, they lay down and refused to move.
After cutting their traces that they might follow him
if they chose, the man set forth alone, with bowed head
and uncertain steps, on a hopeless quest for his comrades.
He did not find them, as we know, though once
he heard a faint cry from off to one side. Heading in
that direction, the next thing he knew he had plunged
over the precipice, and found himself sliding, rolling,
and bounding downward with incredible velocity.</p>

<p>“The trip must have lasted an hour or more,” said
Jalap Coombs, soberly, in describing it, “and when I
finally brung up all standing, I couldn’t make out for
quite a spell whether I were still on top of the earth
or had gone plumb through to the other side. I
knowed every rib and timber of my framing were
broke, and every plank started; but somehow I managed
to keep my head above water, and struck out for
shore. I made port under a tree, and went to sleep.
When I woke at the end of the watch, I found all
hatches closed and battened down. So I were jest
turning over again when I heerd a hail, and knowed I
were wanted on deck. And, boys, I’ve had happy moments
in my life, but I reckon the happiest of ’em all
were when I broke out and seen you two, with the kid,
standing quiet <em>and</em> respectful, and heerd ye saying,
‘Good morning, sir, and hoping you’ve passed a quiet
night,’ like I were a full-rigged cap’n.”</p>

<p>“As you certainly deserve to be, Mr. Coombs,”
laughed Phil, “and as I believe you will be before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
long, for I don’t think we can be very far from salt
water at this moment.”</p>

<p>“It’s been seeming to me that I could smell it!” exclaimed
the sailor-man, eagerly sniffing the air as he
spoke. “And, ef you’re agreeable, sir, I moves that
we set sail for it at once. My hull’s pretty well battered
and stove in, but top works is solid, standing
and running rigging all right, and I reckon by steady
pumping we can navigate the old craft to port yet.”</p>

<p>“All aboard, then! Up anchor, and let’s be off!”
shouted Phil, so excited at the prospect of a speedy
termination to their journey that he could not bear a
moment’s longer delay in attaining it. At present he
cared little that they had evidently wandered far from
the Chilkat trail, as was shown by the westward trend
of the valley in which they now found themselves.
That it still descended sharply, and by following it
they must eventually reach the ocean, was enough.</p>

<p>So they set merrily and hopefully forth, and followed
the windings of the valley, keeping just beyond
the forest edge. In summer-time they would have found
it filled with impassable obstacles—huge bowlders, landslides,
a net-work of logs and fallen trees, and a roaring
torrent; but now it was packed with snow to such an
incredible depth that all these things lay far beneath
their feet, and the way was made easy.</p>

<p>By nightfall they had reached the mouth of the
valley, and saw, opening before them, one so much
wider that it reminded them of the broad expanse of
the frozen Yukon. The course of this new valley was
almost north and south, and they felt certain that it
must lead to the sea. In spite of their anxiety to follow
it, darkness compelled them to seek a camping-place
in the timber. That evening they ate all that
remained of their pemmican, excepting a small bit
that was reserved for Nel-te’s breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>They made up, as far as possible, for their lack of
food by building the most gorgeous camp-fire of the
entire journey. They felled several green trees close
together, and built it on them so that it should not
melt its way down out of sight through the deep
snow. Then they felled dead trees and cut them into
logs. These, together with dead branches, they piled
up, until they had a structure forty feet long by ten
feet high. They set fire to it with the last match in
their possession, and as the flames gathered headway
and roared and leaped to the very tops of the surrounding
trees, even Phil was obliged to acknowledge
that at last he was thoroughly and uncomfortably
warm. The contrast between that night and the previous
one, passed in a snow burrow high up on the
mountains, amid the howlings of a furious gale, without
food, fire, or hope, was so wonderful that all declared
they had lived months since that dreadful time
instead of only a few hours.</p>

<p>The following morning poor Jalap was so stiff and
lame that his face was contorted with pain when he attempted
to rise.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he cried, cheerily, as he noted Phil’s
anxious expression, “I’ll fetch it. Just give me a few
minutes’ leeway.”</p>

<p>And, sure enough, in a few minutes he was on his
feet rubbing his legs, stretching his arms, and twisting
his body “to limber up the j’ints.” Although in a
torment of pain, he soon declared himself ready for
the day’s tramp, and they set forth. Ere they had
gone half a mile, however, it was evident that he could
walk no farther. The pain of the effort was too great
even for his sturdy determination, and when he finally
sank down with a groan, the boys helped him on the
sledge, and attached themselves to its pulling-bar with
long thongs of rawhide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The two stalwart young fellows, together with three
dogs, made a strong team, but the snow was so soft,
and their load so heavy, that by noon they had not
made more than ten miles. They had, however, reached
the end of their second valley, and come upon a most
extraordinary scene. As far as the eye could reach on
either side stretched a vast plain of frozen whiteness.
On its farther border, directly in front of them, but
some ten miles away, rose a chain of mountains bisected
by a deep, wide cut like a gateway.</p>

<p>“It must be an arm of the sea, frozen over and covered
with snow,” said Phil.</p>

<p>“But,” objected Serge, “on this coast no such body
of salt water stays frozen so late in the season; for we
are well into April now, you know.”</p>

<p>“Then it is a great lake.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of any lake on this side of the mountains.”</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon it’s the sea; but salt water’s mighty
nigh,” said Jalap Coombs, sniffing the air as eagerly as
a hound on the scent of game.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is,” said Phil, “we’ve got to cross it,
and I am going to head straight for that opening.”</p>

<p>So they again bent to their traces, and a few hours
later had crossed the great white plain, and were skirting
the base of a mountain that rose on their left. Its
splintered crags showed the dull red of iron rust wherever
they were bare of snow, and only thin fringes of
snow were to be seen in its more sheltered gorges.</p>

<p>Suddenly Phil halted, his face paled, and his lips
quivered with emotion. “The sea!” he gasped. “Over
there, Serge!”</p>

<p>Jalap Coombs caught the words and was on his feet
in an instant, all his pains forgotten in a desire to once
more catch a glimpse of his beloved salt water.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Serge, after a long look. “It certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
is a narrow bay. How I wish we knew what
one! But, Phil! what is that down there near the
foot of the cliffs? Is it—can it be—a house?”</p>

<p>“Where?” cried Phil. “Yes, I see! I do believe
it is! Yes, it certainly is a house.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI</a><br />
<small>THE MOST FAMOUS ALASKAN GLACIER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That little house nestling at the base of a precipitous
mountain, and still nearly a mile away, was just
then a more fascinating sight to our half-starved, toil-worn
travellers than even the sea itself, and, filled with
a hopeful excitement, they hastened towards it. The
way led down a steep incline, and along a shallow, treeless
valley, shut off from the water on their right by a
ridge a hundred feet or so in height. From this depression
the house was hidden until they were directly
upon it; but the knowledge that it was there filled
them with cheerful anticipations of food, warmth, rest,
and a hearty welcome from people of their own race.
It was probably a salmon cannery or saltery, or a
trading-post. At any rate, the one house they had discovered
was that of a white man; for it had a chimney,
and none of the Tlingits or natives of southern Alaska
build chimneys.</p>

<p>While Phil and Jalap Coombs were full of confidence
that a few minutes more would find them in a settlement
of white men, Serge was greatly puzzled, and,
though he said little, kept up a deal of thinking as he
tugged at the rawhide sledge-trace. He felt that he
ought to know the place, for he did not believe they
were more than one hundred miles from Sitka; but he
could not remember having heard of any white settlement
on that part of the coast, except at the Chilkat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
cannery, and this place did not correspond in any particular
with what he had heard of that.</p>

<p>At length they rounded the last low spur of the
ridge, and came upon the house only a few rods away.
For a few moments they stood motionless, regarding it
in silence, and with a bitter disappointment. It was
roughly but substantially constructed of sawed lumber,
had a shingled roof, two glass windows, a heavy
door, and a great outside chimney of rough stone. But
it was closed and deserted. No hospitable smoke curled
from its chimney, there was no voice of welcome nor
sign of human presence. Nor was there another building
of any kind in sight. The little cabin in the now
distant wilderness from which Phil had taken Nel-te
had not been more lonely than this one.</p>

<p>“I suppose we may as well keep on and examine the
interior now that we’ve come so far,” said Phil, in
a disgusted tone that readily betrayed his feelings.
“There doesn’t seem to be any one around to prevent
us. I only wish there was.”</p>

<p>So they pushed open the door, which was fastened
but not locked, and stepped inside. The cabin contained
but a single large room furnished with several
sleeping-bunks, a stout table, and a number of seats,
all home-made from unplaned lumber. Much rubbish,
including empty bottles and tin cans, was scattered
about; but it was evident that everything of value
had been removed by the last occupants. The chief
feature of the room was an immense and rudely artistic
fireplace at its farther end. Above this hung
a smooth board skilfully decorated with charcoal
sketches, and bearing the legend “Camp Muir.”</p>

<p>As Serge caught sight of this he uttered an exclamation.
“Now I know where we are!” he cried. “Come
with me, Phil, and I will show you one of the grand
sights of the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>With this he dashed out of the door, and ran
towards the beach ridge behind which the cabin stood.
Phil followed, wondering curiously what his friend
could mean. As they reached the low crest of the
ridge he understood; for outspread before him, bathed
in a rosy light by the setting sun, was a spectacle that
tourists travel from all parts of the world to gaze upon.</p>

<p>A precipitous line of ice-cliffs of marble whiteness
or heavenly blue, two miles long and hundreds of feet
in height, carved into spires, pinnacles, minarets, and
a thousand other fantastic shapes, rose in frozen
majesty at the head of a little bay whose waters
washed the beach at their feet. Ere either of the
boys could find words to express his delight and
wonder, a huge mass of the lofty wall broke away and
plunged into the sea, with a thunderous roar that
echoed and re-echoed from the enclosing mountains.
For a moment it disappeared in a milky cloud of
foam and spray. Then it shot up from the depths
like some stupendous submarine monster, and, with torrents
of water streaming from it in glittering cascades,
floated on the heaving surface a new-born iceberg.</p>

<p>“It must be a glacier,” said Phil, in an awe-stricken
tone.</p>

<p>“It is a glacier,” answered Serge, triumphantly, “and
one of the most famous in the world, for it is the <span class="smcap">Muir</span>,
which is larger and contains more ice than all the
eleven hundred glaciers of Switzerland put together.
That cabin is the one occupied by John Muir and his
companions when they explored it in 1890. To think
that we should have come down one of its branches,
and even crossed the great glacier itself, without
knowing what it was! I believe we would have known
it, though, if the snow hadn’t been so deep as to alter
the whole character of its surface.”</p>

<p>“If this is the Muir Glacier,” reflected Phil, “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
don’t see but what we are in a box. We must be to
the westward of Chilkat.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Serge. “It lies to the eastward of those
mountains.”</p>

<p>“Which don’t look as though they would be very
easy even for us to climb, while I know we couldn’t
get Jalap and Nel-te over them. I don’t suppose any
tourist steamers will be visiting this place for some
time, either.”</p>

<p>“Not for two months at least,” replied Serge.</p>

<p>“Which is longer than we can afford to wait without
provisions or supplies of any kind. So we shall
have to get away, somehow, and pretty quickly too.
It doesn’t look as though we could follow the coast
any farther, though; for just below here the cliffs
seem to rise sheer from the water.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Serge, “we can’t. We can only get out
by boat or by scaling the mountains.”</p>

<p>“In which case we shall starve to death before we
have a chance to do either,” retorted Phil, gloomily,
“for we are pretty nearly starved now. In fact, old
man, it looks as though the good-fortune that has
stood by us during the whole of this journey had deserted
us at its very end.”</p>

<p>By this time the boys had strolled back to the
cabin, which was left by the setting sun in a dark
shadow. As they turned its corner they came upon
Nel-te standing outside clapping his chubby hands,
and gazing upward in an ecstasy of delight. Following
the child’s glance Phil uttered a startled exclamation,
and sprang through the doorway. A moment
later he emerged, rifle in hand.</p>

<p>High up on a shoulder of the mountain, hundreds of
feet above the cabin, sharply outlined against the sky,
and bathed in the full glory of the setting sun, a mountain
goat, with immensely thick hair of snowy white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and sharp black horns, stood as motionless as though
carved from marble. Blinded by the sunlight, and
believing himself to be surrounded by a solitude untenanted
by enemies, he saw not the quietly moving
figures in the dim shadows beneath him.</p>

<p>Twice did Phil raise his rifle and twice did he lower
it, so tremulous was he with excitement and a knowledge
that four human lives depended on the result of
his shot. The third time he took a quick aim and
fired. As the report echoed sharply from the beetling
cliffs, the stricken animal gave a mighty leap straight
out into space, and came whirling downward like a
great white bird with broken wings. He struck twice,
but bounded off each time, and finally lay motionless,
buried in the snow at the very foot of the mountain
that had been his home.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Phil. “No starvation this time!
Luck <em>is</em> still with us, after all. That is, Nel-te is still
with us, and he seems to carry good luck; for we
certainly should not have seen that fellow but for the
little chap. So, hurrah, old man!”</p>

<p>But Serge needed no urging this time to shout as
loudly as Phil, though while he shouted he got the
sledge ready for bringing in their game.</p>

<p>“Seeing as how we hain’t got no fire nor no matches,
I reckon we’ll eat our meat raw, like the Huskies,” said
Jalap Coombs, dryly, a little later, as they began to
skin and cut up the goat.</p>

<p>“Whew!” ejaculated Phil. “I never thought of
that. But I know how to make a fire with the powder
from a cartridge, if one of you can furnish a bit of cotton
cloth.”</p>

<p>“It seems a pity to waste a cartridge,” said Serge,
“when we haven’t but three or four left, and a single
one has just done so much for us. I think I can get
fire in a much more economical way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“How?” queried Phil.</p>

<p>“Ye won’t find no brimstone nor yet feathers here,”
suggested Jalap Coombs, with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” laughed Serge; “you two keep on
cutting up the goat, and by the time your job is completed
I think I can promise that mine will be.” So
saying, Serge entered the cabin and closed the door.</p>

<p>In a pile of rubbish he had noticed several small
pieces of wood and a quantity of very dry botanical
specimens, some of which bore fluffy seed-vessels that
could be used as tinder. He selected a bit of soft pine,
and worked a small hole in it with the point of his
knife. Next he whittled out a thick pencil of the
hardest wood he could find, sharpened one end and
rounded the other. In a block of hard wood he dug
a cavity, into which the rounded top of the pencil
would fit. He found a section of barrel hoop, and
strung it very loosely with a length of rawhide from a
dog harness, so as to make a small bow. Finally he
took a turn of the bow-string about the pencil, fitted
the point into the soft pine that rested on the floor, and
the other end into the hard-wood block, on which he
leaned his breast.</p>

<p>With one hand he now drew the bow swiftly to and
fro, causing the pencil to revolve with great rapidity,
and with the other he held a small quantity of tinder
close to its point of contact with the soft pine. The
rapid movement of the pencil produced a few grains of
fine sawdust, and this shortly began to smoke with the
heat of friction. In less than one minute the sawdust
and tinder were in a glow that a breath fanned into a
flame, and there was no longer any doubt about a fire.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>That evening, as our friends sat contentedly in front
of a cheerful blaze, after a more satisfactory meal than
they had enjoyed for many a day, Jalap Coombs remarked
that he only wanted one more thing to make
him perfectly happy.</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Phil. “What’s your want?”</p>

<p>“A pipeful of tobacco,” replied the sailor, whose
whole smoking outfit had been lost with his sledge.</p>

<p>“All I want,” laughed Phil, “is to know how and
when we are to get out of this trap, and continue our
journey to Sitka. I hate the thought of spending a
couple of months here, even if there are plenty of
goats.”</p>

<p>“I can’t think of anything else we can do,” said
Serge, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>And yet those who were to rescue them from their
perplexing situation were within five miles of them at
that very moment.</p>

<p>“A goat is a good thing so far as it goes,” remarked
Phil, gravely, “but one goat divided among
one man, two boys, a little chap, and three awfully
hungry dogs isn’t likely to last very long. With
plenty of goats ready to come and be killed as we
wanted them we might hold out here, after a fashion,
until the arrival of a tourist steamer. Wouldn’t that
be fun, though? And wouldn’t we astonish the tourists?
But how we should hate goat by that time!
Still, I don’t think there is the slightest chance of our
having that experience, for I understand that mountain
goats are among the shyest and most difficult to kill of
all wild animals.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Serge, “and your chance for
that shot was one of the luckiest things I ever heard
of. You might hunt goats for years, and not have it
happen again.”</p>

<p>“Which being the case,” continued Phil, “it won’t
do for us to live as though we had goats to squander.
Consequently, we must make an effort to get out of
here before our provision is exhausted. As we have
no boat in which to go to Sitka, and the nearest point
at which we can obtain one is Chilkat, that is the place
we have got to reach somehow. So I propose that
Serge and I take a prospecting trip into the mountains
to-morrow, and see what chance there is for our crossing
them. We will be back by dark, and, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
knowledge thus gained, perhaps we can decide to-morrow
evening what is best to be done.”</p>

<p>As no better plan than this was offered, Phil and
Serge started early the following morning on their
tedious climb. Each carried a gun, and they took
Musky and Luvtuk with them in the hope of getting
a bear, as Serge had heard that bears were plentiful
in those mountains. Nel-te was left to take care of
the hospital, in which Jalap Coombs, with his many
aches, and Amook, with his cut feet, were the patients.</p>

<p>That afternoon was so warm that the door of the
little cabin stood wide open. Before a fire that smouldered
on the broad hearth Jalap Coombs dozed in a
big chair, while Nel-te romped with Amook on the
floor. Now the little chap was tantalizing the dog
with the fur-seal’s tooth, which, still attached to its
buckskin thong, he had taken from his neck. He
would dangle it close to Amook’s nose, and when the
dog snapped at it snatch it away with a shout of
laughter.</p>

<p>While the occupants of the cabin were thus engaged
the heads of several Indians were suddenly but
cautiously lifted above the beach ridge. After making
certain that no one was in the vicinity of the house,
one of their number swiftly but noiselessly approached
it. Crouching under a side wall, he slowly raised his
head. A single glance seemed to satisfy him, for he
immediately began to retrace his steps as quietly as he
had come.</p>

<p>This Indian was one of a party of Chilkat hunters
who had come to Glacier Bay in pursuit of hair seals,
which in the early spring delight to float lazily about
on the drifting ice-cakes. They had camped at the
mouth of Muir Inlet the night before, and during the
day had slowly hunted their way almost to the foot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the great glacier. While there they discovered a thin
spiral of smoke curling from the cabin chimney. This
so aroused their curiosity that they determined to investigate
its cause. They imagined that some of the
interior Indians, who were strictly forbidden by the
Chilkats to visit the coast, had disobeyed orders, and
come to this unfrequented place to surreptitiously
gather in a few seals. In that case the hunters would
immediately declare war, and the prospect of scalps
caused their stolid faces to light and their dull eyes to
glitter.</p>

<p>When it was discovered that a white man was in the
cabin, the Indians were greatly disappointed, but concluded
to withdraw without allowing him to suspect
their presence, for the Chilkats have no love for white
men. But for Nel-te and Amook they would have
succeeded in this, and our travellers would never have
known of their dusky visitors, or the chance for escape
offered by their canoes.</p>

<p>If the fur-seal’s tooth had been able to speak just
then it would have said, “I am disgusted with the
ways of white people. In their hands I am treated
with no respect. They lose me and find me again with
indifference. They even give me to children and dogs
as a plaything. How different was my position among
the noble Chilkats! By their Shamans and chiefs I
was venerated; by the common people I was feared;
while all recognized my extraordinary powers. To
them I am determined to return.”</p>

<p>With this the fur-seal’s tooth, which was at that moment
dangling from Nel-te’s hand, gave itself such a
vigorous forward swing that Amook was able to seize
the buckskin thong, which immediately slipped into a
secure place between two of his sharp teeth. As Nel-te
attempted to snatch back his plaything, the dog sprang
up and darted from the open doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment the Indian who had inspected the
cabin was just disappearing over the beach ridge. At
sight of him Amook uttered a yelp, and started in pursuit.
The Indian heard him, and ran. He sprang into
the canoe, already occupied by his fellows, and shoved
it off as Amook, barking furiously, gained the water’s
edge. Lying a few feet away, and resting on their
paddles, the Indians taunted him. Suddenly one of
their number called attention to the curious white object
dangling from the dog’s mouth. They gazed at it
with ever-increasing excitement, and finally one of them
began to load his gun with the intention of shooting
the dog, and so securing the coveted trophy that so
miraculously appeared hanging from his jaws. Ere
he could carry out his cruel intention little Nel-te appeared
over the ridge in hot pursuit of his playmate.
Without paying the slightest heed to the Indians, he
ran to the dog, disengaged the buckskin thong from his
teeth, slipped it over his own head, tucked the tooth
carefully inside his little parka, and started back towards
the cabin. Amook followed him, while the Indians
regarded the whole transaction with blank amazement.</p>

<p>Both Nel-te and Amook regained the cabin, and
were engaged in another romp on its floor before Jalap
Coombs awoke from his nap. A little later, when he
was surprised by the appearance of half a dozen Indians
before the door, he thrust the child and dog behind
him, and standing in the opening, axe in hand,
boldly faced the new-comers. In vain did they talk,
shout, point to Nel-te, and gesticulate. The only idea
they conveyed to the sailor-man was that they had
come to carry “Cap’n Kid” back to the wilderness.</p>

<p>“Which ye sha’n’t have him, ye bloody pirates!
Not so long as old Jalap can swing an axe!” he cried,
at length wearied of their vociferations and slamming
the door in their faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of this the Indians were so determined to
attain their object that they were planning for an attack
on the cabin, when all at once there came a barking
of other dogs, and, looking in that direction, they
saw two more white men, armed with guns, coming
rapidly towards them.</p>

<p>“Hello in the house! Are you safe? What is the
meaning of all this?” cried Phil, in front of the closed
door.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” replied Jalap Coombs, joyfully, flinging
it open. “We’re safe enough so far; but them
black swabs overhauled us awhile ago, and gave out as
how they’d got to have Cap’n Kid. I double-shotted
the guns, stationed the crew at quarters, and returned
reply that they couldn’t have him. Then they run up
the black flag and allowed they’d blow the ship out of
water. With that I declined to hold further communication,
cleared for action, and prepared to repel
boarders.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Serge was talking to the natives in
Chinook jargon. Suddenly he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“They are Chilkats, Phil, and they want something
that they seem to think is in Nel-te’s possession.”</p>

<p>“In Nel-te’s possession?” repeated Phil, in a puzzled
tone. “What can they mean? I don’t see how
they can know anything about Nel-te, anyway. They
can’t mean the fur-seal’s tooth, can they?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what they do mean!” replied
Serge, after asking the natives a few more questions.
“They say it is hanging about his neck, inside of his
parka.”</p>

<p>“How long have these people been here, Mr.
Coombs?” queried Phil.</p>

<p>“Not more’n ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Have they seen Nel-te?”</p>

<p>“No, for he hain’t been outside the door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Could they have seen him at any time during the
day?”</p>

<p>“Not without me knowing it; for he hain’t left my
side sence you boys went away.”</p>

<p>“Then it is more certain than ever that there is
magic connected with the fur-seal’s tooth, and that the
Chilkats are in some way involved in it. How else
could they possibly have known that it was in our possession,
just where to find us, and, above all, the exact
position of the tooth at this moment?”</p>

<p>“It surely does look redicerlous,” meditated Jalap
Coombs; while Serge said he was glad Phil was becoming
so reasonable and willing to see things in a
true light.</p>

<p>“How did these fellows get here?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“They say they came in canoes,” replied Serge.</p>

<p>“Ask them if they will take us to Sitka, provided
we will give them the fur-seal’s tooth?”</p>

<p>“No; the Indians could not do that.”</p>

<p>“Will they give us a canoe in exchange for it?”</p>

<p>“They say they will,” replied Serge, “if we will go
with them to their village and allow their Shaman
(medicine-man) to examine the tooth, and see whether
or not it is the genuine article.”</p>

<p>“Won’t that be awfully out of our way?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think about seventy-five miles; but
then we may find a steamer there that will take us to
<a href="#i_fp248">Juneau</a>, or even to Sitka itself.”</p>

</div>

<p>“It would certainly be better than staying here,” reflected
Phil. “And I know that neither Serge nor I
wants to try the mountain trail again after what we
have seen to-day. So I vote for going to Chilkat.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” assented Serge.</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Jalap Coombs; “though ef anybody
had told me half an hour ago that I’d been shipping
for a cruise along with them black pirates before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
supper-time, I’d sartainly doubted him. It only goes
to prove what my old friend Kite Roberson useter say,
which were, ‘Them as don’t expect nothing is oftenest
surprised.’”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE TREACHEROUS SHAMAN OF KLUKWAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>So delighted were the Chilkat hunters to know that
they were to have the honor of conveying the fur-seal’s
tooth back to their tribe that they wished to
start at once. The whites, however, refused to go before
morning, and so the Indians returned down the
inlet to their camp of the preceding night, where they
would cache what seals they had obtained in order to
make room in the canoes for their unexpected passengers.
They agreed to be back by daylight.</p>

<p>After they were gone, and our travellers had disposed
of their simple but highly appreciated meal of goat
meat and tea, they gathered about the fire for the last
of those “dream-bag talks,” as Phil called them, that
had formed so pleasant a feature of their long journey.
Without saying a word, but with a happy twinkle in
his eyes, Jalap Coombs produced a pipe and a small
square of tobacco, which he began with great care to
cut into shavings.</p>

<p>“Where on earth did you get them?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Found the pipe in yonder rubbish,” replied the
sailor-man; “and Cap’n Kid give me the ’baccy just
now.”</p>

<p>“Nel-te gave you the tobacco? Where did he get
it?”</p>

<p>“Dunno. I were too glad to get it to ask questions.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Phil, “the mysteries of this place are
beyond finding out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“This one isn’t,” laughed Serge, “though I suppose
it would be if I hadn’t happened to see one of the Indians
slip that bit of tobacco into Nel-te’s hand.”</p>

<p>“What could have been his object in giving such a
thing as that to a child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Chilkat children use it as well as their elders;
and I suppose he wanted to gain Nel-te’s good-will,
seeing that he is the guardian of the fur-seal’s
tooth. I shouldn’t be surprised if he hoped in some
way to get it from the child before we reached the
village.”</p>

<p>“Which suggests an idea,” said Phil, removing the
trinket in question from Nel-te’s neck and handing it
to Serge. “It is hard to say just who the tooth does
belong to now, it has changed hands so frequently, but
it will be safer for the next day or two with you than
anywhere else. Besides, it is only fair that, as it came
directly from the Chilkats to you, or, rather, to your
father, you should have the satisfaction of restoring it
to them.”</p>

<p>So Serge accepted from Phil the mysterious bit of
ivory that he had given the latter more than a year before
in distant New London, and hung it about his neck.</p>

<p>“Last night,” said Phil, after this transfer had taken
place, “Mr. Coombs and I only needed a pipeful of
tobacco and a knowledge of how we were to escape
from here to make us perfectly happy. Now we have
both.”</p>

<p>“The blamed pipe won’t draw,” growled Jalap
Coombs.</p>

<p>“While I,” continued Phil, “am bothered. I know
we must go with those fellows, but I don’t trust them,
and shall feel uneasy so long as we are in their power.”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” asked Serge, “that these things go
to prove that there isn’t any such thing in this world
as perfect happiness?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” answered Phil; “only that it is extremely rare.
How is it with you, old man? Does the approaching
end of our journey promise you perfect happiness?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” cried Serge, vehemently. “In spite
of its hardships, I have enjoyed it too much to be glad
that it is nearly ended. But most of all, Phil, is the
fear that its end means a parting from you; for I suppose
you will go right on to San Francisco, while I
must stay behind.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” admitted Phil. “But, at any rate,
old fellow, this journey has given me one happiness
that will last as long as I live, for it has given me your
friendship, and taught me to appreciate it at its true
worth.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Phil,” replied Serge, simply. “I value
those words from you more than I should from any
one else in the world. Now I want to tell you what I
have to thank the journey for besides a friendship. I
believe it has shown me what is to be my life-work.
You know that missionary at Anvik said he was more
in need of teachers than anything else. While I don’t
know very much, I do know more than those Indian
and Eskimo boys, and I did enjoy teaching them.
So, if I can get my mother to consent, I am going back
to Anvik as soon as I can, and offer my services as a
teacher.”</p>

<p>“It is perfectly splendid of you to think of it,” cried
Phil, heartily; “and all I can say is that the boys who
get you for a teacher are to be envied.”</p>

<p>So late did the lads sit up that night talking over
their plans and hopes that on the following morning
the Indians had arrived and were clamorous for them
to start before they were fairly awake. By sunrise
they, together with the three dogs, were embarked in
a great long-beaked and marvellously carved Chilkat
canoe, hewn from a single cedar log and painted black.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Two of the Indians occupied it with them; while the
others and the sledge went in a second but smaller
canoe of the same ungraceful design as the first.</p>

<p>As with sail set and before the brisk north breeze
that ever sweeps down the glacier, the canoes sped
away among the ice floes and bergs of the inlet, our
boys cast many a lingering backward glance at the
little cabin that had proved such a haven to them, and
at the stupendous ice-wall gleaming in frozen splendor
on their horizon. Under other conditions they would
gladly have stayed and explored its mysteries. Now
they rejoiced at leaving it.</p>

<p>So favoring were the winds that they left Glacier
Bay, passed Icy Strait, and headed northward as far as
the mouth of Lynn Canal before sunset of that day.
During the second day they ran the whole fifty-mile
length of the canal, which is the grandest of Alaska’s
rock-walled fiords, entered Chilkat Inlet, passed the
canneries at Pyramid Harbor and Chilkat, which would
not be opened until the beginning of the salmon season
in June, entered the river, and finally reached Klukwan,
the principal Chilkat village.</p>

<p>Here, as the smaller canoe had preceded them and
announced their coming, our travellers <a href="#i_fp254">were welcomed
by the entire population</a> of the village. These thronged
the beach in a state of the wildest excitement, for it
was known to all that the long-lost fur-seal’s tooth was
at last come back to them. Even the village dogs were
there, a legion of snarling, flea-bitten curs. Ere the
canoe touched the beach, Musky, Luvtuk, and big
Amook were among them, and a battle was in progress
that completely drowned the cries of the spectators
with its uproar. The fighting was continued, with
only brief intervals, throughout the night; but in the
morning the three champions from the Yukon were
masters of the situation, and roamed the village with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
bushy tails proudly curled over their backs and without
interference. “For all the world,” said Phil, “like
the Three Musketeers.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_254">THEY WERE WELCOMED BY THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF KLUKWAN</a></div>
</div>

<p>The guests of the village were escorted to the council-house,
to which were also taken their belongings.
Here they were supplied with venison, salmon, partridges,
and dried berries; and here, after supper, they
received many visitors, all anxious for a sight of the
magic tooth. Most prominent of these were the head
Shaman of the village, and the principal woman of the
tribe, whose name was so unpronounceable that Phil
called her “<a href="#i_fp256">The Princess</a>,” a title with which she seemed
to be well pleased.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;">
<a id="i_fp256">
  <img src="images/i_fp256.jpg" width="368" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_255">A CHILKAT “PRINCESS”</a></div>
</div>

<p>She was the widow of Kloh-kutz, most famous of
Chilkat chiefs, and the one who had presented the fur-seal’s
tooth to Serge Belcofsky’s father. On the occasion
of this visit she wore a beautifully embroidered
dress, together with a Chilkat blanket of exquisite
fineness thrown over her shoulders like a shawl, and
fastened at the throat with a stout safety-pin. The
Princess devoted herself to Serge, whom she evidently
considered the most important person in the party,
and to little Nel-te, who took to her at once. While
she pronounced the fur-seal’s tooth to be the same
that had belonged to her husband, the Shaman shook
his head doubtfully. Then it was handed from one to
another of a number of lesser Shamans and chiefs for
inspection. Suddenly one of these dropped it to the
floor, and, when search was made, it could not be
found.</p>

<p>Phil was furious at the impudence of this trick.
Even Serge was indignant; while Jalap Coombs said
it was just what might be expected from land-sharks
and pirates.</p>

<p>The Shaman insisted that the tooth was not lost, but
had disappeared of its own accord. If it were not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
same fur-seal’s tooth that belonged to their tribe in
former years, it would not be seen again. If it were,
it would appear within a few days attached to a hideously
carved representative of Hutle, the thunder-bird
that stood in one of Kloh-kutz’s houses, now used as a
place for incantation.</p>

<p>“We don’t care anything about all that!” exclaimed
Phil, when this was translated to him. “Tell him he
can do as he pleases with the tooth, so long as he gives
us the canoe we have bargained for.”</p>

<p>To this the Shaman replied that they should surely
have a canoe as soon as the tooth proved its genuineness
by reappearing. In the meantime, if they were
in such a hurry to get away that they did not care to
wait, he had a very fine canoe that he would let them
have at once in exchange for their guns and their
dogs.</p>

<p>“You may tell him that we will wait,” replied Phil,
grimly, “but you need not tell him what is equally
true—that we shall only wait until we find a chance to
help ourselves to the best canoe in the village and take
French leave.”</p>

<p>So they waited, though very impatiently, in Klukwan
for nearly a week, during which time Phil had
ample opportunities for studying Chilkat architecture
and totem poles. The houses of the village were all
built of heavy hewn planks set on end. They had
bark or plank roofs, with a square opening in each for
the egress of smoke. Many of them had glass windows
and ordinary doors; but in others the doors were placed
so high from the ground as to be reached by ladders
on both outside and inside. The great totem poles that
stood before every house were ten, twenty, or thirty
feet tall, and covered with heraldic carvings from bottom
to top.</p>

<p>During this time of waiting the Shaman made repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
offers to sell the strangers a canoe, all of which
were indignantly declined. That they did not appropriate
one to their own use was for the very simple
reason that all, except a few very small or leaky canoes,
mysteriously disappeared from the village that first
night.</p>

<p>At length the tricky medicine-man was forced to
yield to the threats of the Princess, who had taken the
part of our travellers from the first, and to popular
clamor. He therefore announced one evening that he
had been informed during a vision that the fur-seal’s
tooth would reappear among them on the morrow.</p>

<p>On the following morning Phil and his companions
were aroused by a tremendous shouting and firing of
guns, all of which proclaimed that the happy event
had taken place.</p>

<p>“Now,” cried Phil, “perhaps we will get our canoe.”</p>

<p>But there were no canoes to be seen on the beach,
and the Shaman coolly informed them that, though the
precious tooth had indeed come back to dwell with the
Chilkats, they would still be obliged to wait until some
of the canoes returned from the hunting expeditions
on which they had all been taken.</p>

<p>At this Phil fell into such a rage that, regardless of
consequences, he was on the point of giving the old
fraud a most beautiful thrashing, when his uplifted
arm was startlingly arrested by the deep boom of a
heavy gun that seemed to come from the mouth of the
river.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX</a><br />
<small>INVADING A CAPTAIN’S CABIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>An earthquake could hardly have caused greater
consternation in the village of Klukwan than did the
boom of that heavy gun as it came echoing up the
palisaded valley of the Chilkat. Not many years before
the Indians of that section had defied the power
of the United States, and killed several American citizens.
A gunboat, hurried to the scene of trouble,
shelled and destroyed one of their villages in retaliation.
From that time on, no sound was so terrible to
them as the roar of a big gun.</p>

<p>While Phil and his companions were chafing at the
delay imposed upon them by the greed of the Chilkat
Shaman, a government vessel arrived in the neighboring
inlet of Chilkoot, bearing a party of scientific men,
who were to cross the mountains at that point for an
exploration of the upper Yukon, and the locating of
the boundary-line between Alaska and Canada.</p>

<p>The Princess, learning of its presence, and despairing
of assisting her white friends in any other way, secretly
despatched a messenger to the captain of the ship
with the information that some Americans were being
detained in Klukwan against their will. Upon receipt
of this news the captain promptly steamed
around into Chilkat Inlet, and as near to its head as
the draught of his vessel would allow. As he dropped
anchor, there came such a sound of firing from up the
river that he imagined a fight to be in progress, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
fired one of his own big guns to give warning of his
presence.</p>

<p>The effect of this dread message was instantaneous.
Phil Ryder dropped his uplifted arm. The Chilkat
Shaman scuttled away, issued an order, and within five
minutes a new and perfectly equipped canoe was marvellously
produced from somewhere and tendered to
Serge Belcofsky. Five minutes later he and his companions
had taken a grateful leave of the Princess, and
were embarked with all their effects, including the three
dogs.</p>

<p>Phil stationed himself in the bow, Serge tended sheet,
and Jalap Coombs steered. As before the prevailing
northerly wind their long-beaked canoe shot out from
the river into the wider waters of the inlet, and they
saw, at anchor, less than a mile away, a handsome
cutter flying the United States revenue flag, the three
friends uttered a simultaneous cry of:</p>

<p>“The <i>Phoca</i>!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Phil.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” echoed Serge.</p>

<p>“Bless her pretty picter!” roared Jalap Coombs,
standing up and waving the old tarpaulin hat that,
though often eclipsed by a fur hood, had been faithfully
cherished during the entire journey.</p>

<p>Even Musky, Luvtuk, and big Amook caught the prevailing
excitement, and gave vent to their feelings in
loud and joyous barkings.</p>

<p>At that moment one of the cutter’s boats, in command
of a strange lieutenant, with a howitzer mounted
in its bows, and manned by a dozen heavily armed
sailors, hailed the canoe and shot alongside.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble up the river?” demanded the
officer.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any,” answered Phil.</p>

<p>“What was all the firing about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Celebrating some sort of native Fourth of July.
Is Captain Matthews still in command of the <i>Phoca</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Does he know you?”</p>

<p>“I rather guess he does, and, with your permission,
we’ll report to him in person.”</p>

<p>With this the canoe shot ahead, leaving the lieutenant
greatly puzzled as to whether he should follow it
or continue up the river, though he finally concluded
to adopt the former course.</p>

<p>“Pull up the hoods of your parkas,” said Phil to his
companions, “and we’ll give the captain a surprise-party.”</p>

<p>A minute later one of the <i>Phoca’s</i> quartermasters
reported to the captain that a canoe-load of natives
was almost alongside.</p>

<p>“Very well; let them come aboard, and I’ll hear
what they have to say.”</p>

<p>In vain did the quartermaster strive to direct the
canoe to the port gangway. The natives did not seem
to understand, and insisted on rounding up under the
starboard quarter, reserved for officers and distinguished
guests. One of them sprang out the moment
its bow touched the side steps, clambered aboard,
pushed aside the wrathful quartermaster, and started
for the captain’s door with the sailor in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>“Hold on, you blooming young savage! Ye can’t
go in there,” he shouted, but to heedless ears.</p>

<p>As Phil gained the door it was opened by the commander
himself, who was about to come out for a look
at the natives.</p>

<p>“How are you, Captain Matthews?” shouted the fur-clad
intruder into the sacred privacy of the cabin, at
the same time raising a hand in salute. “It is awfully
good of you, sir, to come for us. I only hope you
didn’t bother to wait very long at the Pribyloffs.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What? Who are you, sir? What does this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
mean? Phil Ryder! You young villain! You scamp!
Bless my soul, but this is the most wonderful thing I
ever heard of!” cried the astonished commander, staggering
back into the cabin, and pulling Phil after him.
“May, daughter, look here!”</p>

<p>At that moment there came a yelping rush, and with
a chorus of excited barkings Musky, Luvtuk, and
big Amook dashed pell-mell into the cabin. After
them came Serge, Jalap Coombs, and the horrified
quartermaster, all striving in vain to capture and restrain
the riotous dogs. As if any one could prevent
them from following and sharing the joy of the young
master who had fed them night after night for months
by lonely camp-fires of the Yukon Valley!</p>

<p>So they flung themselves into the cabin, and tore
round and round, amid such a babel of shouts, laughter,
barkings, and crash of overturned furniture as was
never before heard in that orderly apartment.</p>

<p>Finally the terrible dogs were captured, one by one,
and led away. May Matthews emerged from a safe
retreat, where, convulsed with laughter, she had witnessed
the whole uproarious proceeding. Her father,
still ejaculating “Bless my soul!” at intervals, gradually
recovered sufficient composure to recognize and
welcome Serge and “Ipecac” Coombs, as he persisted
in calling poor Jalap. The upset chairs were placed to
rights, and all hands began to ask questions with such
rapidity that no one had time to pause for answers.</p>

<p>From the confusion Captain Matthews finally evolved
an understanding that the boys were still desirous of
reaching Sitka, whereupon he remarked:</p>

<p>“Sitka! Sitka! It never occurred to me that you
had any desire to visit Sitka. I thought your sole
ambition was to attain the North Pole. If you had
only mentioned Sitka last summer I might have arranged
the trip for you; but now I fear—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment there came a knock at the door,
and when it was opened the quartermaster began to
say, “Excuse me, sir, but here’s another—” Before
he could finish his sentence a small furry object
jerked away from him with such force that it took
a header into the room, and landed at the feet of the
commander on all fours, like a little bear.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! What’s this?” cried Captain
Matthews, springing to one side in dismay.</p>

<p>“It’s a baby!” screamed Miss May, darting forward
and snatching up the child. “A darling little
Indian in furs. Where did it come from?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Phil, remorsefully. “To
think that we should have forgotten Nel-te!”</p>

<p>“Are there any more yet to come?” demanded the
captain.</p>

<p>“No, sir; the whole ship’s company is present <em>and</em>
accounted for,” replied Jalap Coombs. “But with
your leave, sir, I’ll just step out and take a look at our
boat, for she’s a ticklish craft to navigate, and might
come to grief in strange hands.”</p>

<p>So saying, the honest fellow, glad of an excuse to
escape from the cabin, where he felt awkward and
out of place, as well as uncomfortably warm in his fur
garments, pulled at the fringe of long wolf’s hairs surrounding
his face, and shuffled away. A few minutes
later saw him in the forecastle, where, divested of his
unsailor-like parka, puffing with infinite zest at one
of the blackest of pipes filled with the blackest of
tobacco, and the centre of an admiring group of seamen,
he was spinning incredible yarns of his recent
and wonderful experiences with snow-shoes and
sledges.</p>

<p>In the meantime May Matthews was delightedly
winning Nel-te’s baby affections, while Phil and Serge
were still plying the captain with questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Were you saying, sir, that you feared you couldn’t
take us to Sitka?” inquired Serge, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not at all, my lad,” replied the captain. “I was
about to remark that I feared you would not care to
go there now, seeing that there is hardly any one in
Sitka whom you want to see, unless it is your mother
and sisters and Phil Ryder’s father and aunt Ruth.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Phil, “my Aunt Ruth! Are you
certain, sir?”</p>

<p>“Certain I am,” replied Captain Matthews, “that if
both the individuals I have just mentioned aren’t already
in Sitka, they will be there very shortly, for I
left them in San Francisco preparing to start at once.
Moreover, I have orders to carry your father to St.
Michaels, where he expects to find you. So now you
see in what a complication your turning up in this outlandish
fashion involves me.”</p>

<p>“But how did my aunt Ruth ever happen to come
out here?” inquired Phil.</p>

<p>“Came out to nurse your father while his leg was
mending, and incidentally to find out what had become
of an undutiful nephew whom she seems to fancy has
an aptitude for getting into scrapes,” laughed the captain.</p>

<p>“Has my father recovered from his accident?”</p>

<p>“So entirely that he fancies his leg is sounder and
better than ever it was.”</p>

<p>“And are you bound for Sitka now, sir?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I am, and should have been half-way
there by this time if I hadn’t been delayed by a report
of some sort of a row between the Chilkats and a party
of whites. Now, having settled that difficulty by capturing
the entire force of aggressors, I propose to carry
them to Sitka as legitimate prisoners, and there turn
them over to the authorities. So, gentlemen, you will
please consider yourselves as prisoners of war, and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
orders not to leave this ship until she arrives at
Sitka.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, sir,” laughed Phil. “Only don’t
you think you’d better place us under guard?”</p>

<p>“I expect it will be best,” replied the captain, gravely,
“seeing that you are charged with seal-poaching,
piracy, defying government officers, and escaping from
arrest, as well as the present offence of making war on
native Americans.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL</a><br />
<small>IN SITKA TOWN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The long-beaked and wonderfully carved Chilkat
canoe was taken on the <i>Phoca’s</i> deck, the anchor was
weighed, and, with the trim cutter headed southward,
the last stage of the adventurous journey, pursued
amid such strange vicissitudes, was begun. As the
ship sped swiftly past the overhanging ice-fields of
Davidson Glacier, out of Chilkat Inlet into the broad,
mountain-walled waters of Lynn Canal, and down that
thoroughfare into Chatham Strait, Captain Matthews
listened with absorbed interest to Phil’s account of the
remarkable adventures that he and Serge had encountered
from the time he had last seen them at the
Pribyloff Islands down to the present moment.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, when the recital was finished, “I’ve
done a good bit of knocking about in queer places
during thirty years of going to sea, and had some experiences,
but my life has been tame and monotonous
compared with the one you have led for the past year.
Why, lad, if an account of what you have gone through
in attempting to take a quiet little trip from New
London to Sitka was written out and printed in a book,
people wouldn’t believe it was true. They’d shake
their heads and say it was all made up, which only
goes to prove, what I never believed before, that truth
is sometimes stranger than fiction, after all.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Phil; “and the strangest part of it
all is the way that fur-seal’s tooth has followed us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and exerted its influence in our behalf from the beginning
to the very end. Why, sir, if it hadn’t been for
that tooth you wouldn’t have come to Chilkat, and we
shouldn’t be in the happy position we are at this very
moment.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say,” cried Captain Matthews,
“that it turned up again after your father lost it?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir, and it’s been with us, off and on, all
the time.”</p>

<p>“Then at last I can have the pleasure of showing
it to my daughter. Would you mind letting me have
it for a few minutes?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, sir—”</p>

<p>“Now don’t tell me that you have gone and lost it
again!”</p>

<p>“Not exactly lost it,” replied Phil. “At the same
time, I don’t know precisely where it is nor what has
become of it, only it is somewhere back in Klukwan,
where it originally came from, and I have every reason
to believe that it is in possession of the principal
Chilkat Shaman.”</p>

<p>“I declare, that is too bad!” exclaimed the captain.
“If I had known that sooner I believe I should have
kept right on and shelled the village until they gave
me the tooth, so strong is my desire to get hold of it.”</p>

<p>“And so secured to yourself the ill-luck of him who
steals it,” laughed Phil.</p>

<p>That afternoon the <i>Phoca</i> turned sharply to the
right, and began to thread the swift-rushing and rock-strewn
waters of Peril Strait, the narrow channel that
washes the northern end of Baranoff Island, on which
Sitka is situated. Now Serge stood on the bridge
beside his friend, so nervous with excitement that he
could hardly speak. Every roaring tide rip and swirling
eddy of those waters, every rock with its streamers
of brown kelp, every beach and wooded point, were like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
familiar faces to the young Russo-American, for just
beyond them lay his home, that dear home from which
he had been more than three years absent.</p>

<p>Suddenly he clutched Phil’s arm and pointed to a
lofty, snow-crowned peak looming high above the
forest and bathed in rosy sunlight. “There’s Mount
Edgecumbe!” he cried; and a few minutes afterwards,
“There’s Verstovoi!” Phil felt the nervous fingers
tremble as they gripped his arm; and when, a little
later, the cutter swept from a narrow passage into an
island-studded bay, he could hardly hear the hoarse
whisper of: “There, Phil! there’s Sitka! Dear, beautiful
Sitka!”</p>

<p>And Phil was nearly as excited as Serge to think
that, after twelve months of ceaseless wanderings, the
goal for which he had set forth was at last reached.</p>

<p>Serge pointed out in rapid succession the picturesque
Greek church, the quaint little house known as <a href="#i_fp266">the
Governor’s Mansion</a>, the marine barracks, the solid
log structure of the old Russian trading company, the
long, straggling Indian village, and the fine “Governor’s
Walk” leading to beautiful Indian River. But
he looked in vain for the most conspicuous landmark
of all; for old Baranoff Castle, crowning Katlean’s
Rock, had been destroyed by fire since he left home.</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_267">GOVERNOR’S MANSION, SITKA, ALASKA</a></div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Phoca</i> had hardly dropped anchor before another
ship appeared entering the bay from the same direction.
“The mail-steamer from Puget Sound,” announced
Captain Matthews.</p>

<p>This boat brought but few passengers, for the season
was yet too early for tourists; but on her upper deck
stood a gentleman and a lady, the former of whom
was pointing out objects of interest almost as eagerly
as Serge had done a short time before.</p>

<p>“It is lovely,” said his companion, enthusiastically,
“but it seems perfectly incredible that I should actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
be here, and that this is the place for which our
Phil set out with such high hopes a year ago. Do you
realize, John, that it is just one year ago to-day since
he left New London? Oh, if we only knew where the
dear boy was at this minute! And to think that I
should have got here before him!”</p>

<p>“Now he will probably never get here,” replied Mr.
Ryder; “for, on account of that California offer, I
shall be obliged to return directly to San Francisco
from St. Michaels without even a chance of going up
the Yukon, which I know will be a great disappointment
to Phil. But look there, Ruth. You have been
wanting to see a canoe-load of Indians, and here comes
as typical a one as I ever saw. A perfect specimen of
an Alaskan dug-out, natives in full winter costume,
Eskimo dogs, and a sledge, I declare! They must
have just come back from a hunting expedition to the
mainland. See the snow-shoes slung on their backs,
and how gracefully they handle their paddles! Even
Phil might take a lesson from them in that.”</p>

<p>“And, oh!” cried Miss Ruth, “there is a tiny bit
of a child, all in furs, just like its father. See? Nestled
among the dogs, with a pair of wee snow-shoes on
his back too. Isn’t he a darling? How I should love
to hug him! Oh, John, we must find them when we
get ashore; for that child is the very cutest thing I
have seen in all Alaska.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Mr. Ryder, smiling good-naturedly
at his sister’s enthusiasm. “We will watch
and see where they make a landing.”</p>

<p>By this time the steamer was made fast, and the
passengers were already going ashore. When Mr.
Ryder and his sister gained the wharf they were surprised
to see that the very canoe in which they were
interested had come to the landing-stage, where its
occupants were already disembarking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“What fair complexions they have for Indians,”
said Miss Ruth, stopping to watch the natives. As
the foremost of them ran up the steps, she moved
aside to let him pass. The next moment she uttered a
shriek of horror, for he had suddenly thrown his arms
about her neck and kissed her.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp268">“Aunt Ruth, you’re a brick! a perfect brick!”</a> he
cried. “To think of you coming away out here to see
me!” Then turning to Mr. Ryder, and embracing
that bewildered gentleman in his furry arms, the excited
boy exclaimed: “And pop. You dear old pop!
If you only knew how distressed I have been about
you! If you hadn’t turned up just as you have, I should
have dropped everything and gone in search of you.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_fp268">
  <img src="images/i_fp268.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_269">“AUNT RUTH, YOU’RE A BRICK! A PERFECT BRICK!”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Phil, how could you?” gasped Aunt Ruth.
“You frightened me almost to death, and have crushed
me all out of shape. You are a regular polar-bear in
all those furs and things. What do you mean, sir?
Oh, you dear, dear boy!” At this point Miss Ruth’s
feelings so completely overcame her that she sat down
on a convenient log and burst into hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>“There, you young scamp!” cried Mr. Ryder, whose
own eyes were full of joyful tears at that moment.
“See what you have done! Aren’t you ashamed of
yourself, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, pop, awfully. But I’ve got something that
will cheer her up and amuse her. And here’s Serge
and— No he isn’t, either. What has become of
Serge? Oh, I suppose he has gone home. Don’t see
why he need be in such a hurry, though. No matter;
here’s Jalap Coombs. You remember Jalap, father?
And here, Aunt Ruth, is the curio I promised to bring
you from Alaska. Look out; it’s alive!”</p>

<p>With this the crazy lad snatched Nel-te from the
arms of Jalap Coombs, who had just brought him up
the steps, and laid him in Miss Ruth’s lap, saying, “He’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
a little orphan kid that I found in the wilderness, and
adopted for you to love.”</p>

<p>Miss Ruth gave such a start as the small bundle of
fur was so unexpectedly thrust at her that poor Nel-te
rolled to the ground. From there he lifted such a
pitifully frightened little face, with such tear-filled
eyes and quivering lips, that Miss Ruth snatched him
up and hugged him. Then she kissed and petted him
to such an extent that by the time he was again smiling
he had won a place in her loving heart second only
to that occupied by Phil himself.</p>

<p>In the meantime Musky, Luvtuk, and big Amook
were tearing madly up and down the wharf, yelping
and barking their joyful recognition of the fact that
the long journey, with its months of hard work, was
ended, and for them at least play-time had come.</p>

<p>With this journey’s end also came the partings that
always form so sad a feature of all journeys’ ends.
Even the three dogs that had travelled together for so
long were separated, Musky being given to Serge,
Luvtuk to May Matthews, to become the pet of the
<i>Phoca’s</i> crew, and big Amook going with Phil, Aunt
Ruth, Nel-te, the sledge, the snow-shoes, and the beautiful
white, thick-furred skin of a mountain goat to
distant New London.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder and Jalap Coombs accompanied them as
far as San Francisco. Dear old Serge was reluctantly
left behind, busily making preparations to carry out
his cherished scheme of returning to Anvik as a
teacher.</p>

<p>In San Francisco Mr. Ryder secured for Jalap
Coombs the command of a trading schooner plying
between that port and Honolulu. When it was announced
to him that he was at last actually a captain,
the honest fellow’s voice trembled with emotion as he
answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Ryder, sir, <em>and</em> Phil, I never did wholly look
to be a full-rigged cap’n, though I’ve striv and waited
for the berth nigh on to forty year. Now I know that
it’s jest as my old friend Kite Roberson useter say; for
he allus said, Kite did, that ‘Them as waits the patientest
is bound to see things happen.’”</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
